In order to write content for the Jekyll blog, I had to learn Markdown. It is definitely not a complicated language but as my brain seems to not be able to remember about it easily, so I decided to create a "cheat sheet" of most used symbols. Enjoy!

### Code

backticks before and after the codeblock are mandatory

If the code block is on several lines, three backticks are necessary

*Language, if precised, must be next to the first three backticks*
