As I transition to the role of a solution architect, I find it intriguing to share my insights, questions, and the gradual process of becoming proficient in this position.

In my first post, I’ll introduce myself, discuss my experience as a technical leader, describe how the shift began, and explore my understanding of responsibilities and collaboration with other team members.

### As a technical leader...

My role involved overseeing both the technical and functional aspects of the development implemented by the team. My primary focus was to *ensure that the development aligned with the business needs and didn’t accumulate technical debt*.

Additionally, I facilitated *peer reviews and technical sharing sessions* to enhance the development team’s awareness of the application’s technical environment.

Lastly, I emphasized *staying up-to-date with new features* introduced by libraries and frameworks, while closely *monitoring the lifecycle of the versions used* (including libraries, frameworks, and databases) to prevent vulnerabilities and manage technical debt.

### The decision

<br/>
At the end of 2021, due to a company reorganization, I faced a decision: remain in software development or transition to solution architecture

Despite not having a precise understanding of the role or feeling fully prepared for it, I chose to shift toward solution architecture long-term goal of mine

### And now what ?

Two and a half years later, I find myself working as a solution architect—though sometimes the role feels elusive. 

Some days, I’m completely lost, while others, I grasp my responsibilities clearly. 

In this series of posts, I'll document everything, hoping to gain greater clarity about my duties and activities.

Cheers!
