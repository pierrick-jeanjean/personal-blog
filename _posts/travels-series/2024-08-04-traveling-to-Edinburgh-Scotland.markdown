One of my personal goals is to visit as many countries as possible. This summer, I decided to spend part of my vacation exploring Scotland, with a special focus on Edinburgh

### Day 1: The arrival

I arrived on the afternoon of July 25th, after a four-hour journey with a layover in London. Being quite stressed, I didn’t sleep well the night before, so I decided to take it easy on the first day. 

After being on the Knight bus (!), I arrived at my apartment and I spent most of my day wandering around the apartment

### Day 2: Old city, old whisky

My second day was much busier than the first! I started off really early, and after a quick breakfast, I visited the Old Town in Edinburgh, attempting to take proper pictures of the buildings (and failing, obviously…).

Among the many shops and restaurants, I found a particular café that rang a bell: “The Elephant House,” where J.K. Rowling spent part of her time writing the Harry Potter books. I even got to try their Butterscotchbeer, a beverage reminiscent of Butterbeer!

I had planned to visit Edinburgh Castle right after that, but it was already full, so I decided to postpone it to Monday afternoon. However, I didn’t waste my time and managed to buy a scarf and a cap as souvenirs from Edinburgh.

Later, I experienced a fantastic scotch tasting with food pairing. It was very interesting, and even though I’m not a big fan of scotch, I enjoyed it. I especially liked the third one, which was really smoky.

### Day 3: From the river to the sea

On my third day in Edinburgh, I began by exploring the picturesque Dean Village, a charming area known for its historic buildings and tranquil atmosphere. From there, I followed the scenic path along the Leith River, enjoying the lush greenery and peaceful surroundings as I made my way towards the coast.

After reaching the end of the Leith River, I treated myself to a comforting chai latte, a perfect reward after the exercise. Refreshed, I decided to head to Granton Beach.

At Granton Beach, I spent a relaxing afternoon walking along the shoreline, taking in the fresh sea breeze and the beautiful views. 

### Day 4: Grassmarket, a cemetery, a dog, and a hike 

### Day 5: Memories

### Day 6: The departure
