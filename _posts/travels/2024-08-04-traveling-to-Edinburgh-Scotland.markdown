One of my personal goals is to visit as many countries as possible. This summer, I decided to spend part of my vacation exploring Scotland, with a special focus on Edinburgh

### Day 1: The arrival

I arrived on the afternoon of July 25th, after a four-hour journey with a layover in London. Being quite stressed, I didn’t sleep well the night before, so I decided to take it easy on the first day. 

After being on the Knight bus (!), I arrived at my apartment and I spent most of my day wandering around the apartment

### Day 2: Old city, old whisky

My second day was way busier than the first one! I started off really early and after a quick breakfast, I visisted the Old Town in Edinburgh, trying to take proper pictures of buildings (and failing obviously...)

Among many shops and restaurants, I found one particular café that rang a bell in my head, "The Elephant House" where J.K. Rowling spent part of her time writing Harry Potter books. I even was able to try out their Butterscotchbeer - a beverage that is reminiscent of the Butterbeer!

Right after that, I was supposed to visit Edinburgh's castle however it was already full, so I decided to postpone to Monday afternoon. I however didn't waste my time as I scored one scarf and one cap, as souvenirs from Edinburgh

Then I experienced a really great scotch tasting (with food pairing). It was very interesting and even if I'm not a fan of scotch, I did enjoy it, I especially liked the third one, really smokey

### Day 3: From the river to the sea



### Day 4: Grassmarket, a cemetery, a dog, and a hike 

### Day 5: Memories

### Day 6: The departure
