One of my personal goals is to visit as many countries as possible. This summer, I decided to spend part of my vacation exploring Scotland, with a special focus on Edinburgh

### Day 1: The arrival

I arrived on the afternoon of July 25th, after a four-hour journey with a layover in London. Being quite stressed, I didnâ€™t sleep well the night before, so I decided to take it easy on the first day. 

I spent most of the day wandering around the apartment I rented and searching for a good spot to enjoy some haggis and have my first pint of beer of the trip.

Because I am a huge fan of Edgar Write's work and also because I really enjoyed "Cornetto" trilogy, finding out that there is a pub called "The World's end" seemed almost fate.

### Day 2: Old city, old whisky

### Day 3: I am not a great hiker

### Day 4: Wandering inside and outside the city

### Day 5: Memories...

### Day 6: The departure
