One of my personal goals is to visit as many countries as possible. This summer, I decided to spend part of my vacation exploring Scotland, with a special focus on Edinburgh

### Day 1: The arrival

I arrived on the afternoon of July 25th, after a four-hour journey with a layover in London. Being quite stressed, I didn‚Äôt sleep well the night before, so I decided to take it easy on the first day. 

After being on the Knight bus (!), I arrived at my apartment and I spent most of my day wandering around the apartment

### Day 2: Old city, old whisky

My second day was much busier than the first! I started off really early, and after a quick breakfast, I visited the Old Town in Edinburgh, attempting to take proper pictures of the buildings (and failing, obviously‚Ä¶).

Among the many shops and restaurants, I found a particular caf√© that rang a bell: ‚ÄúThe Elephant House,‚Äù where J.K. Rowling spent part of her time writing the Harry Potter books. I even got to try their Butterscotchbeer, a beverage reminiscent of Butterbeer!

I had planned to visit Edinburgh Castle right after that, but it was already full, so I decided to postpone it to Monday afternoon. However, I didn‚Äôt waste my time and managed to buy a scarf and a cap as souvenirs from Edinburgh.

Later, I experienced a fantastic scotch tasting with food pairing. It was very interesting, and even though I‚Äôm not a big fan of scotch, I enjoyed it. I especially liked the third one, which was really smoky.

### Day 3: From the river to the sea

On my third day in Edinburgh, I began by exploring the picturesque Dean Village, a charming area known for its historic buildings and tranquil atmosphere. From there, I followed the scenic path along the Leith River, enjoying the lush greenery and peaceful surroundings as I made my way towards the coast.

After reaching the end of the Leith River, I treated myself to a comforting chai latte, a perfect reward after the exercise. Refreshed, I decided to head to Granton Beach.

At Granton Beach, I spent a relaxing afternoon walking along the shoreline, taking in the fresh sea breeze and the beautiful views. I ended up the day with a fish and chips on the beach, seems appropriate

### Day 4: Grassmarket, a cemetery, a dog, and a hike 

On the fourth day in Edinburgh, I began my adventure at the vibrant Grassmarket, where the sound of bagpipes filled the air, creating a truly Scottish atmosphere. From there, I made my way to Greyfriars Kirkyard, a historic cemetery known for its Harry Potter references. I also paid my respects to Greyfriars Bobby, the loyal dog who guarded his master‚Äôs grave for 14 years.

Next, I explored the National Museum of Scotland, which offered a fascinating glimpse into the country‚Äôs rich history and culture. The museum houses a diverse collection, including artifacts from Scottish antiquities, natural history, science, technology, and world cultures.

With the sun shining brightly, I decided to hike up to Arthur‚Äôs Seat, an extinct volcano. The hike was pleasant and manageable, and the panoramic view from the summit was absolutely breathtaking.

### Day 5: Memories

During my stay in Edinburgh, I had a photoshoot at iconic spots like Edinburgh Castle, Victoria Street, and Calton Hill. The city‚Äôs charm and stunning backdrops made for some unforgettable photos.

I couldn‚Äôt leave Scotland without trying haggis. In a cozy pub, I enjoyed a traditional plate of haggis, neeps, and tatties. The rich flavors were a delightful culinary experience.

Before leaving, I visited gift shops and found beautiful scarves made from authentic Scottish wool. The vibrant tartan patterns and soft texture made them perfect souvenirs.
