### Ingredients (for 3 persons):

- 40 grams butter
- 12 small white pearl onions or 3 spring onions, chopped
- 1 small iceberg lettuce, thickly sliced
- 3 grams caster sugar
- 150 ml vegetable stock
- 340 grams fresh peas (weight after being podded) or frozen peas
- 20 grams tablespoons cr√®me fra√Æche
- 2-3 stalks of fresh mint

### Instructions

1. **Heat the butter** in a large saucepan and add the onions and lettuce. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes until the onions and lettuce are soft but not colored. If the pan gets too hot, add a little vegetable stock.
2. **Pour in the vegetable stock** and add the caster sugar. Bring to a boil and continue to cook on a fast boil for 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.
4. **Add the peas to the stock** with the onions and lettuce. Cook over low to medium heat for 10 minutes for fresh peas or 5 minutes for frozen peas, until they are cooked through but still vibrant green and slightly firm.
5. **Add the cr√®me fra√Æche** just before the end of the cooking time and gently mix. Allow to heat through for about 1-2 minutes.
6. **Check the seasoning** once more and adjust to taste. Serve immediately with sprigs of fresh mint on top.
