Leek and mushroom saut√© is perfect for October in France because it highlights the fresh, seasonal flavors of leeks and mushrooms. As the weather cools, this warm, earthy dish provides comfort and pairs well with hearty autumn meals. üçÇüçÑ

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 large leek, cleaned and sliced into thin rounds
- 150 grams of mushrooms, sliced
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon of dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- a splash of white wine

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the leek**: Cut off the dark green tops and root ends of the leek. Slice the leek into thin rounds and rinse thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit.
2. **Cook the leek**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5-7 minutes.
3. **Add the mushrooms**: Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet with the leek. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their moisture and start to brown, about 5-7 minutes.
4. **Add garlic and thyme**: Stir in the minced garlic and thyme. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant.
5. **Season and finish**: Season with salt and pepper to taste. If using, add a splash of white wine or vegetable broth and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the flavors are well combined.
6. **Serve**: Transfer the leek and mushroom saut√© to a serving dish and enjoy as a side with your favorite main course.
