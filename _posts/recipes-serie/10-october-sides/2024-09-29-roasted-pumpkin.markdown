Roasted pumpkin is ideal for October in France because it’s peak season, offering fresh and flavorful produce. The warm dish suits the cooler weather and provides essential nutrients. Its versatility with herbs and spices makes it a delicious and nutritious addition to any meal. 🍂🎃

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 small pumpkin (about 2.2 lbs)
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 teaspoons of thyme
- 2 teaspoons of paprika

### Instructions:

1. **Pre-heat your oven**: to 200°C.
2. **Prepare the pumpkin**: Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Save the seeds for roasting separately if you like.
3. **Cut into chunks**: Slice the pumpkin into even-sized chunks or wedges. You can leave the skin on if it’s thin and edible, or peel it off if you prefer.
4. **Season**: Place the pumpkin pieces on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices you’re using. Toss to coat evenly.
5. **Roast**: Spread the pumpkin pieces out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender and slightly caramelized around the edges. Flip the pieces halfway through for even roasting.
6. **Serve**: Enjoy the roasted pumpkin as a side dish, or use it in salads, grain bowls, or as a topping for soups.
