#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the swiss chards provencal style**:
- 500 g Swiss chard (leaves and stalks)
- 2 ripe tomatoes (or 200 g canned diced tomatoes)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 30 mL olive oil
- Salt, pepper, herbes de Provence (or thyme/basil)

**For the polenta**:
- 150 g polenta (instant or regular)
- 600 mL water or chicken broth
- 30 g butter
- 50 g grated Parmesan (optional)
- Salt to taste

**For the poached egg**:
- 3 fresh eggs
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- Salt

### Instructions

**Blanch chards**: <br/>
Wash and chop the chard (separate stalks and leaves). Blanch stalks for 5 min, then add leaves for 2 min. Drain.

**Sauté**: <br/>
In a pan, sauté onion and garlic in olive oil. Add tomatoes and herbs, cook 5 min. Add chard, season, and simmer 10–15 min.

**Cook the polenta**: <br/>
Bring water/broth to a boil with a pinch of salt. Slowly whisk in polenta to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring, for 5–10 min (or as per package). Stir in butter and cheese until creamy.

**Prep water**: <br/>
Bring a pot of water to a gentle simmer. Add vinegar.

**Poach**: <br/>
Crack each egg into a small bowl. Create a whirlpool in the water and gently slide in the egg. Cook for 3 minutes.

**Drain**: <br/>
Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towel. Trim any wispy edges if desired.
