#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the swiss chards provencal style**:
- 500 g Swiss chard (leaves and stalks)
- 2 ripe tomatoes (or 200 g canned diced tomatoes)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 30 mL olive oil
- Salt, pepper, herbes de Provence (or thyme/basil)

**For the polenta**:
- 150 g polenta (instant or regular)
- 600 mL water or chicken broth
- 30 g butter
- 50 g grated Parmesan (optional)
- Salt to taste

**For the roasted chicken thighs**:
- 3 chicken thighs
- 30 mL olive oil
- 5 g paprika
- 5 g dried thyme or rosemary
- Salt and pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- Optional: lemon juice or zest

### Instructions

1. **Blanch chards**:
Wash and chop the chard (separate stalks and leaves). Blanch stalks for 5 min, then add leaves for 2 min. Drain.
2. **Sauté**:
In a pan, sauté onion and garlic in olive oil. Add tomatoes and herbs, cook 5 min. Add chard, season, and simmer 10–15 min.
3. **Cook the polenta**:
Bring water/broth to a boil with a pinch of salt. Slowly whisk in polenta to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring, for 5–10 min (or as per package). Stir in butter and cheese until creamy.
4. **Prepare the chicken**:
Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Rub chicken with oil, spices, garlic, and herbs.
5. **Roast the chicken**:
Roast for 35–40 minutes until golden and cooked through. Optional: broil for 2–3 minutes for extra crispiness.
6. **Putting it all together**
Plate a scoop of creamy polenta. Top with a roasted chicken thigh. Add a generous spoonful of Blettes à la Provençale on the side. Garnish with fresh herbs or a lemon wedge.
