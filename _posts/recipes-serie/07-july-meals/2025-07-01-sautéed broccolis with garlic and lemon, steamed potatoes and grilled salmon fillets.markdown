#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the sautéed broccolis with garlic and lemon**:
- 500g broccoli (cut into florets)
- 3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 30mL olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the steamed potatoes**:
- 600 g baby potatoes (halved)
- Salt
- Optional: a drizzle of olive oil or a knob of butter

**For the grilled salmon fillets**:
- 3 salmon fillets (about 150–180 g each)
- 15mL olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- Optional: a pinch of paprika or herbes de Provence
- Lemon wedges for serving

### Instructions

1. **Blanch the broccoli**: Steam or blanch the broccoli for 3–4 minutes until just tender but still bright green.
2. **Sauté**:
In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden. Add broccoli, lemon zest, and juice. Toss well to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 2–3 more minutes. Serve warm.
3. **Cook the potatoes**:
Place potatoes in a steamer or pot with a steaming basket. Steam for 15–20 minutes until fork-tender. Season with salt and optionally drizzle with olive oil or butter before serving.
4. **Prepare the salmon**:
Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush salmon with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and optional herbs.
5. **Grill the salmon**:
Grill skin-side down for 4–5 minutes, then flip and cook another 3–4 minutes until just cooked through. Serve with lemon wedges.
6. **Putting it all together**
Place the salmon diagonally off-center on the plate, pile up broccoli next to the salmon and spread potatoes on the rest of the plate. Add lemon wedges
