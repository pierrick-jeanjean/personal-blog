Crique is a delightful way to enjoy a nutritious and satisfying meal. Made primarily from potatoes, it provides a good source of carbohydrates, which are essential for energy. The addition of eggs offers high-quality protein, while onions add a dose of vitamins and antioxidants. Cooking with olive oil not only enhances the flavor but also contributes healthy fats, which are beneficial for heart health. Plus, the crispy texture and savory taste make crique a comforting and enjoyable dish that can be easily paired with a variety of sides or enjoyed on its own. Bon appÃ©tit! ðŸ˜Š
