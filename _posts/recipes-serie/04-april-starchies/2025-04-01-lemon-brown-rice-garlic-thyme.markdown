#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 180 grams short-grain brown rice
- 475 mL vegetable stock
- 15 g unsalted butter
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 15 mL extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 g garlic (about 1 clove), minced
- 3 g fresh thyme, chopped
- 0.5 grams red chili flakes (optional)
- 15 mL fresh lemon juice
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the rice**: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the finely chopped shallot and cook until softened, about 3-5 minutes. Add the brown rice and cook, stirring frequently, for about 2-3 minutes to lightly toast the grains. Pour in the vegetable stock, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed  
2. **Prepare the flavoring**: In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, chopped thyme, and red chili flakes (if using). Cook for about 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and just starting to brown. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice and zest.
3. **Combine and serve**: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork. Stir in the garlic, thyme, and lemon mixture. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if needed. Serve warm as a side dish or as a base for your favorite protein
