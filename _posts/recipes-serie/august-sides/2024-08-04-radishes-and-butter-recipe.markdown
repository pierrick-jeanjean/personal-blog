Radish and butter is a classic French side dish that combines crisp radishes with creamy butter. It’s simple, refreshing, and celebrates seasonal flavors. The peppery bite of radishes pairs beautifully with the smooth richness of high-quality butter. A pinch of flaky sea salt enhances the overall experience. Bon appétit! 🇫🇷🌱🧈

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- About 12 fresh radishes (French Breakfast Radishes work well)
- High-quality unsalted butter (approximately 3 tablespoons)
- Flaky sea salt (such as Fleur de Sel)

### Instructions:

1. Wash and trim the radishes, removing any greens or stems.
2. Cut each radish in half lengthwise.
