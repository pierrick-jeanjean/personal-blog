Eating fennel and roasted chestnuts in November is perfect for the season. Fennel and chestnuts are at their best in autumn, offering a comforting and nutritious dish. Fennel provides fiber and antioxidants, while chestnuts add complex carbs and minerals, making this a wholesome and warming side for cooler days.


### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 2 fennel bulbs, cut in half
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 large carrot, sliced
- 300 grams of chestnuts (fresh or canned)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables**: In a large pan or stewpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the fennel, onion, and carrot. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.
2. **Simmer the vegetables**: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables simmer for about 50 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
3. **Prepare the chestnuts**: If using fresh chestnuts, make a small cut in the skin of each chestnut. Place them in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and peel the chestnuts. If using canned chestnuts, simply drain and rinse them.
4. **Combine and cook**: Add the chestnuts to the pan with the vegetables. Stir to combine and let everything simmer together for another 15-20 minutes, until the chestnuts are tender and the flavors have melded.
5. **Serve**: This dish pairs wonderfully with roasted meats like turkey, pork, or chicken. Enjoy!
