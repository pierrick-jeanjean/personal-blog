Eating butternut squash soup in November is perfect for the season. The squash is at its freshest, providing rich flavor and nutrients like vitamin A and fiber. This warm, comforting soup is ideal for chilly autumn days, supporting your immune system and bringing cozy vibes to your meals. üçÇ

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 small butternut squash (about 1 pound)
- 1/2 large onion
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 carrot
- 1 celery stalk
- 2 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Salt and pepper to taste


### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the squash**: Peel the butternut squash, cut it in half, remove the seeds, and chop it into cubes. You can soften the squash in the microwave for a few minutes to make peeling easier
2. **Saut√© the vegetables**: In a medium pot, heat the butter over medium heat.Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Saut√© until the vegetables are softened and the onions are translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
2. **Add the squash and broth**: Add the cubed butternut squash to the pot. Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the squash is tender, about 20-25 minutes.
3. **Blend the soup**: Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth. Be careful with hot liquids.
4. **Season and Serve**: Season the soup with salt, pepper, and any optional spices you like. Serve hot, garnished with a dollop of cr√®me fra√Æche, croutons, or toasted pumpkin seeds for added texture and flavor.
