- 3 large artichokes
- 1 lemon, halved
- 60 mL olive oil
- 30 mL red wine vinegar

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the artichokes**:
Trim the stems and remove the tough outer leaves. Cut off the top third of the artichoke and snip the sharp tips of the remaining leaves. Rub the cut parts with lemon to prevent browning.
2. **Cook the artichokes**:
Fill a large pot with water, add the lemon halves, and bring to a boil. Add the artichokes, reduce heat, and simmer for about 30-40 minutes until tender.Drain and let cool slightly.
3. **Make the vinaigrette**:
In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Add fresh herbs if desired.
4. **Prepare the baguette**:
Slice the baguette into pieces.
Optionally, warm the slices in the oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 5 minutes
5. **Prepare the chicken**:
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Brush the chicken breasts with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices.
6. **Grill the chicken**:
Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and juices run clear.
7. **Putting it all together**
Serve the artichokes with vinaigrette, slices of crusty baguette, and grilled chicken breast on a plate.
