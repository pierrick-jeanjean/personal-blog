3. **Cook the quinoa**:
Rinse the quinoa under cold water. In a medium saucepan, bring the water or broth to a boil. Add the quinoa and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and serve.
4. **Prepare the chicken**:

5. **Grill the chicken**:
Grill the chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and juices run clear. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing.
6. **Putting it all together**
Serve the avocado and tomato Salad alongside the quinoa and grilled chicken.
