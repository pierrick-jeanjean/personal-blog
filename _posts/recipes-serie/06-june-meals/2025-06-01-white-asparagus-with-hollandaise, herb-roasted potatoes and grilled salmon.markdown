**For the grilled salmons**:

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the asparagus**: 
Peel the white asparagus and trim the woody ends. Boil in salted water for about 10-15 minutes until tender. Drain and set aside.
2. **Make the Hollandaise Sauce**: 
In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and lemon juice until thickened. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and slowly whisk in the melted butter until the sauce is thick and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
3. **Serve**: 
Arrange the asparagus on a plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce.
4. **Preheat oven: 
Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
5. **Prepare potatoes**: 
Toss the halved potatoes with olive oil, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.
6. **Roast**: 
Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and crispy
7. **Prepare the salmon**: 
Brush the salmon fillets with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
8. **Grill**: 
Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the salmon for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
9. **Serve**: 
Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the grilled salmon before serving.
7. **Putting it all together**
On each plate, arrange 5 spears of white asparagus, a portion of herb-roasted potatoes, and a grilled salmon fillet
