#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the ratatouille**:
- 1.5 eggplants, diced
- 1.5 zucchinis, diced
- 1.5 red bell peppers, diced
- 1.5 yellow bell peppers, diced
- 1.5 onions, diced
- 3 tomatoes, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 70mL olive oil
- 10g dried thyme
- 10g dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the rice**:
- 300g long-grain rice
- 700mL cups water
- 5g salt

**For the roasted lamb**:
- 6 lamb ribs  
- 45mL olive oil
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 5g dried rosemary, chopped
- 5g dried thyme, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven**:
Preheat your oven to 200째C (400째F).
2. **Combine vegetables and season**:
In a large bowl, combine the eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, onion, and tomatoes. Add the minced garlic, olive oil, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat the vegetables evenly.
3. **Roast vegetables**:
Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized, stirring occasionally.
4. **Cook the rice**:
Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.
5. **Prepare the ribs**:
In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture all over the lamb racks.
6. **Sear and roast**:
Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the lamb racks on all sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes for medium-rare, or until the internal temperature reaches 57째C (135째F).
Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing into individual chops.
7. **Putting it all together**
Plate a portion of rice on each plate. Add a generous serving of Ratatouille on the side. Place 2 lamb chops on each plate.
