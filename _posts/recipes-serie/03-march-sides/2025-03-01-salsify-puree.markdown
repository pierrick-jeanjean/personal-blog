Salsify, often referred to as the "oyster plant" due to its subtle oyster-like flavor, is a nutritious root vegetable that offers several health benefits. It is rich in dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. Salsify is also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and iron, which support immune function, heart health, and red blood cell production. Additionally, salsify contains inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Incorporating salsify puree into your diet can be a delicious and nutritious way to enjoy these health benefits.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 450 g of salsify (peeled and chopped)
- 300 ml of vegetable or chicken stock
- 50 g of unsalted butter
- 100 ml of heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A squeeze of lemon juice (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the salsify**: Peel and chop the salsify into small pieces.
2. **Cook the salsify**: In a medium saucepan, add the salsify and stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the salsify is tender.
3. **Blend the salsify**: Drain the salsify, reserving some of the cooking liquid. Transfer the salsify to a blender or food processor.
4. **Add butter and cream**: Add the butter and cream to the blender. Blend until smooth, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if needed to reach your desired consistency.
5. **Season**: Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.
6. **Serve**: Serve the puree warm as a side dish.
