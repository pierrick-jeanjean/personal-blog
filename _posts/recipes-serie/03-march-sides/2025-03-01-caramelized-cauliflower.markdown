Caramelized cauliflower is not only delicious but also packed with health benefits. Cauliflower is rich in vitamins C and K, which support immune function and bone health. It's also high in fiber, aiding digestion and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can help with weight management. The caramelization process enhances the natural sweetness of the cauliflower, making it a tasty and nutritious addition to your diet. Plus, it's a versatile dish that can be enjoyed as a side or a main course, making it a great choice for any meal. Enjoy!
