Collard greens soup is nutritious and delicious. It's rich in vitamins A, C, and K, which support your immune system, skin, and bones. The fiber aids digestion, and the antioxidants help reduce inflammation. Plus, it's low in calories, making it a healthy and satisfying meal. 

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 bunch of collard greens, chopped (400-500g)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 1 liter vegetable broth
- 15 ml olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Wash and chop the collard greens, dice the onion, mince the garlic, peel and dice the potatoes, and slice the carrot.
