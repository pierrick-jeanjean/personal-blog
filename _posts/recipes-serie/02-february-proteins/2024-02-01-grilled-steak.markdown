Grilled steak is a protein-rich option that provides essential nutrients like iron and B vitamins. Grilling enhances the meat's natural flavors, making it juicy and tender. It's a great choice for a balanced diet and pairs well with various sides.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 3 steaks (about 200-250g each, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon)
- 30ml olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- Fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving (optional)

#### Instructions

1. **Season the steaks**: Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Rub both sides with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Optionally, add minced garlic and fresh rosemary or thyme.
2. **Preheat the grill**: Heat your grill to high heat.
3. **Grill the steaks**: Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
4. **Rest the steaks**: Remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute.
5. **Serve with lemon wedges**: Optionally, serve with lemon wedges for a fresh, tangy finish.
