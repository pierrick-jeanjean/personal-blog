Honey mustard chicken thighs are a delicious and nutritious meal. The sweet and tangy marinade enhances the juicy chicken, which is rich in protein and essential vitamins. This dish is flavorful, easy to prepare, and perfect for a balanced diet. 

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 45 g Dijon mustard
- 45 g whole grain mustard
- 45 g honey
- 22.5 ml olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2g fresh rosemary, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Preheat** your oven to 200째C (400째F).
2. **Prepare the marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, whole grain mustard, honey, olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped rosemary (if using).
3. **Season the chicken thighs**: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
4. **Marinate the chicken**: Place the chicken thighs in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. Pour the honey mustard marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.
5. **Roast the chicken thighs**: Arrange the marinated chicken thighs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or in a baking dish. Roast in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F) and the skin is golden and crispy.
6. **Baste with marinade**: Halfway through roasting, baste the chicken thighs with any remaining marinade for extra flavor.
7. **Rest and serve**: Let the chicken thighs rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with additional fresh rosemary if desired.
