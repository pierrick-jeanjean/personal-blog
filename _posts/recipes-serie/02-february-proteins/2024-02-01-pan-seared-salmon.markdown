Pan-seared salmon is a nutritious choice, packed with protein and omega-3 fatty acids for heart and brain health. It's also rich in vitamins D and B12, and selenium, making it a healthy and flavorful option for a balanced meal.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 3 salmon fillets (about 150-200 g each)
- 30ml olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges
- Fresh dill or parsley for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions

1. **Season the salmon fillets**: Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Heat the olive oil** in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. **Sear the salmon**: Place the salmon fillets skin-side down in the skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the salmon is mostly cooked through.
4. **Flip the salmon**: Carefully flip the fillets and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the salmon is cooked to your desired doneness.
5. **Serve with lemon wedges**: Garnish with fresh dill or parsley if desired.
