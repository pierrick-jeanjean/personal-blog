- ½ small red or white onion, thinly sliced
- 15 mL apple cider vinegar
- 30 mL olive oil
- 5 g Dijon mustard (optional)
- Salt and pepper

**For the buckweat crepe**:
- 3 buckwheat galettes (approx. 25–28 cm diameter)

### Instructions

**Prepare the vegetable base**: <br/>
Combine thinly sliced cucumber and onion in a mixing bowl.

**Make the vinaigrette dressing**: <br/>
In a separate bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard (if using), olive oil, salt, and pepper until emulsified.

**Dress the vegetables**: <br/>
Pour the vinaigrette over the cucumber and onion mixture and toss gently to coat.

**Let the salad marinate**: <br/>
Allow it to sit for 15 minutes so the flavors can meld and the texture softens slightly.

**Heat the grill for the fish**: <br/>
Preheat a grill pan or barbecue to medium heat for even cooking.

**Prep and season the trout fillets**: <br/>
Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness.

**Grill the trout fillets**: <br/>
Place skin-side down and cook for 3–4 minutes, then flip and cook another 2–3 minutes until done.

**Add a herbaceous finish**: <br/>
Sprinkle fresh herbs over the trout just before serving to enhance aroma and flavor.

**Warm the galettes for serving**: <br/>
Heat each one in a dry pan over medium heat for 1–2 minutes on each side.

**Optional flavor upgrade**: <br/>
Brush the galettes lightly with butter while warming for added richness and crispness.
