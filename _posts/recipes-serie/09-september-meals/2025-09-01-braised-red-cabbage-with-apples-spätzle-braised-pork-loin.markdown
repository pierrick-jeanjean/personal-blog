- 10 g butter
- 15 mL red wine vinegar

**For the braised pork loin**:

- 1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaf, parsley)

### Instructions

**Sauté onion for the cabbage base**: <br/>
Melt butter in a large pot and cook chopped onion until translucent and fragrant.

**Soften the sliced cabbage**: <br/>
Add the cabbage and stir for about 5 minutes until it begins to soften slightly.

**Add flavorings and season the cabbage**: <br/>
Mix in vinegar, sugar, bay leaf, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and optional white wine. Combine well.

**Simmer the cabbage slowly**: <br/>
Cover the pot and cook over low heat for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

**Add apples for sweetness and depth**: <br/>
Stir in diced apples and continue cooking uncovered for 20 minutes until tender and slightly 
caramelized.

**Finalize the cabbage and adjust taste**: <br/>
Remove the bay leaf and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed before serving.

**Cook the spätzle noodles**: <br/>
Boil according to package instructions until tender, then drain thoroughly.

**Sauté shallots for richness**: <br/>
Melt butter in a pan and sauté the chopped shallot until golden and aromatic.

**Brown the spätzle for extra texture**: <br/>
Add the drained spätzle and toss in the pan until lightly crisped and browned.

**Add herbs and cheese for finishing touch**: <br/>
Sprinkle with chopped parsley or grated Comté cheese right before serving for added flavor.

**Prepare the pork loin for braising**: <br/>
Place in a pot with vegetables, bouquet garni, garlic, and liquid (like broth or wine).

**Simmer the pork until tender**: <br/>
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cook for 1.5 to 2 hours until fork-tender.

**Rest and optionally crisp the pork**: <br/>
Remove from the pot and let rest, or place under a hot grill for 5 minutes to crisp the skin.

**Serve the pork with sides**: <br/>
Slice or serve whole alongside the cabbage and spätzle for a comforting, hearty plate.
