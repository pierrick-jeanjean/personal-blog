- 15 mL olive oil
- 150 mL semi-skimmed milk or crème fraîche
- Salt, pepper, nutmeg
- Optional: 1 sprig of thyme for steaming

**For the steamed potatoes**:
- 450 g potatoes (peeled and cut into chunks)
- Salt
- Optional: melted butter or duck fat for drizzling

**For the duck leg confit**:
- 3 duck legs confit (pre-cooked, preserved in duck fat)

### Instructions

**Steam the pumpkin with herbs**: <br/>
Cook cubed pumpkin with thyme for about 30 minutes until fork-tender and aromatic.

**Mash the pumpkin base**: <br/>
Discard the thyme and mash the pumpkin using a presse-purée until smooth.

**Enrich the purée**: <br/>
Stir in butter, milk or crème, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg for creaminess and warmth.

**Gently reheat for serving**: <br/>
Warm the purée slowly over low heat to bring it to ideal serving temperature.

**Steam the potatoes until tender**: <br/>
Cook whole or halved potatoes for 20–25 minutes until easily pierced with a fork.

**Finish with flavor**: <br/>
Season the potatoes with salt and drizzle with melted butter or duck fat from the confit.

**Preheat the oven for the duck legs**: <br/>
Set it to 180°C to ensure the skin crisps while the meat remains succulent.

**Prepare duck legs for roasting**: <br/>
Place skin-side up in a baking dish with garlic and sprigs of thyme.

**Roast the duck confit**: <br/>
Bake for 20–25 minutes until the skin is golden, crackling, and irresistible.

**Remove excess fat and serve hot**: <br/>
Spoon off any surplus fat and plate immediately for a rich, comforting dish
