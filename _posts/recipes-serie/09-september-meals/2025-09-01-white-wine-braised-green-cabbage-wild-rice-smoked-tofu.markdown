- 100 mL dry white wine
- 15 mL duck fat or olive oil
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 juniper berries (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the wild rice**:
- 200 g wild rice
- 600 mL water or vegetable broth
- 2.5 g salt
- Optional: 15 mL olive oil or 10 g butter

**For the smoked tofu**:
- 400 g extra-firm tofu
- 45 mL soy sauce
- 30 mL rice vinegar
- 5 mL liquid smoke
- Optional: 15 mL maple syrup

### Instructions

**Prep and blanch the cabbage**: <br/>
Remove any tough outer leaves, quarter the cabbage, and blanch in boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain well and slice into strips.

**Sauté aromatics for the cabbage base**: <br/>
Heat fat (like duck fat or butter) in a large sauté pan. Add onion and cook until translucent, then stir in garlic and carrot.

**Simmer cabbage with flavorings**: <br/>
Add the blanched cabbage, white wine, bay leaf, juniper berries, salt, and pepper. Cover and let simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

**Rinse and prep the wild rice**: <br/>
Place the rice in a sieve and rinse under cold running water to remove excess starch and debris.

**Cook the wild rice until tender**: <br/>
Combine the rinsed rice, water, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover.

**Simmer the rice until grains split**: <br/>
Let cook gently for 45–50 minutes until the grains open and become tender. Drain any excess liquid.

**Fluff and dress the rice**: <br/>
Use a fork to fluff the grains, and stir in olive oil or butter if desired for added richness.

**Press the tofu to remove moisture**: <br/>
Wrap the tofu in paper towels or a clean cloth and press for 15–30 minutes to help it crisp up during baking.

**Cut the tofu into desired shapes**: <br/>
Once pressed, slice the tofu into cubes or slabs depending on your serving style.

**Make the tofu marinade**: <br/>
In a bowl, mix soy sauce, vinegar, liquid smoke, and maple syrup to form a flavorful blend.

**Marinate the tofu thoroughly**: <br/>
Add tofu to the marinade and let it soak for at least 30 minutes to absorb all the flavors.

**Bake the tofu until golden and crisp**: <br/>
Place on a lined tray and bake at 180 °C for 40 minutes, flipping halfway through to ensure even browning and texture.
