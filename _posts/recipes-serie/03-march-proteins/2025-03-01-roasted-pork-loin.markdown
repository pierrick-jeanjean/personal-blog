Roasted pork loin is a delicious and nutritious choice for a meal. It's a lean cut of meat, which means it's lower in fat compared to other pork cuts, making it a healthier option. Pork loin is also rich in protein, essential for muscle growth and repair, and provides important vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins, zinc, and selenium. Additionally, roasting enhances the natural flavors of the pork, creating a tender and juicy dish that's both satisfying and versatile. Whether paired with vegetables, grains, or enjoyed on its own, roasted pork loin is a wholesome and flavorful addition to any diet

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 680 g pork loin
- 15 ml olive oil
- 5 g salt
- 2 g black pepper
- 5 g garlic powder
- 5 g paprika
- 5 g dried rosemary
- 15 ml Worcestershire sauce

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 175°C.
2. **Prepare the pork loin**: Pat the pork loin dry with paper towels. Rub it with olive oil and Worcestershire sauce.
3. **Season the pork**: Mix the salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and rosemary in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the pork loin.
4. **Sear the pork**: Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the pork loin on all sides until browned, about 1-2 minutes per side.
5. **Roast the pork**: Place the seared pork loin on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes per 450 grams, or until the internal temperature reaches 63°C. For a 680-gram pork loin, this will take approximately 40-45 minutes.
6. **Rest and serve**: Remove the pork loin from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute. Slice and serve warm
