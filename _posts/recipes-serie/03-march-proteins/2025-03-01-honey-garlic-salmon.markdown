Honey garlic salmon is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Salmon is an excellent source of high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential vitamins and minerals like vitamin D and selenium. Omega-3 fatty acids are known for their heart health benefits, including reducing inflammation and lowering blood pressure. The honey and garlic add a delightful flavor while also providing antioxidants and antimicrobial properties. This dish is a perfect balance of taste and health, making it a great addition to your diet. Enjoy!

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 3 salmon fillets (about 150-200 grams each)
- 45 ml honey
- 45 ml soy sauce
- 30 ml fresh lemon juice
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 15 ml tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the marinade**: In a small bowl, mix honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and minced garlic.
2. **Marinate the salmon**: Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Let them marinate for at least 15-20 minutes.
3. **Cook the salmon**: Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and season with salt and pepper. Cook the salmon fillets for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through and have a nice golden crust.
4. **Add the marinade**: Pour the reserved marinade into the pan and let it simmer for a couple of minutes until it thickens slightly.
5. **Serve**: Plate the salmon fillets and drizzle the thickened sauce over them. Garnish with chopped parsley.
