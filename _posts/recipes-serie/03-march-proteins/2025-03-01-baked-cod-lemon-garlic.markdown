Baked cod with lemon and garlic is not only delicious but also highly nutritious. Cod is a lean source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. It is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart health and reduce inflammation. The addition of lemon provides a refreshing citrus flavor and a boost of vitamin C, which is important for immune function. Garlic adds a savory depth to the dish and has numerous health benefits, including antibacterial properties and the ability to lower blood pressure. Overall, this dish is a great choice for a healthy and satisfying meal.
