Eating baked tofu is a great choice because it's a rich source of plant-based protein, low in calories, and packed with essential nutrients like iron and calcium. Baking tofu makes it crispy and delicious without needing much oil, keeping it healthy. Plus, it's versatile and can be seasoned to suit various tastes, making it a delightful and nutritious addition to any meal. ðŸŒ±

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 21 ounces extra-firm tofu (1.5 blocks)
- 25 mL  olive oil
- 7.5 g cornstarch
- Sea salt to taste
- 2.5 g teaspoon garlic powder
- 2.5 g teaspoon black pepper

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven** to 400Â°F (200Â°C).
2. **Press the tofu**: Slice your blocks of tofu into 2 or 3 slabs, about 3/4 to 1-inch thick. Lay paper towels on a flat surface, place the tofu slabs on top, cover with more paper towels, and place a cutting board with heavy cans or pots on top to press out excess water. Let it drain for at least 15-30 minutes.
3. **Cut the tofu** into cubes (about 3/4-inch each) or your desired shapes.
4. **Season the tofu**: In a large mixing bowl, drizzle the tofu with olive oil and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle with cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper, and gently toss until the tofu is evenly coated.
5. **Bake the tofu**: Arrange the tofu in an even layer on a parchment-covered baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, then flip each piece to cook evenly on the other side. Return to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, or until the tofu reaches your desired level of crispiness.
6. **Enjoy**: Serve the crispy baked tofu in salads, stir-fries, or as a snack!
