#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 6 fresh eggs (2 per person)
- Water
- White vinegar (optional)
- Salt (optional)

#### Instructions

1. **Boil water**: Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.
2. **Prepare the eggs**: Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin. This helps you gently slide the egg into the water.
3. **Add vinegar**: If you like, add a splash of white vinegar to the water. This helps the egg whites stay together.
4. **Create a vortex**: Stir the water to create a gentle whirlpool. This helps the egg whites wrap around the yolk.
5. **Cook the eggs**: Gently slide the eggs into the center of the whirlpool. Cook for about 3 minutes for soft yolks or 4-5 minutes for firmer yolks. You can cook 2-3 eggs at a time, depending on the size of your pot.
6. **Remove and Serve**: Use a slotted spoon to remove the eggs from the water. Dab them on a paper towel to remove excess water. Serve immediately with toast, salt, and pepper.
