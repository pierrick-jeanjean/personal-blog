Roasted pork loin is a delicious and nutritious choice for a meal. It's a lean cut of meat, which means it's lower in fat compared to other pork cuts, making it a healthier option. Pork loin is also rich in protein, essential for muscle growth and repair, and provides important vitamins and minerals such as B vitamins, zinc, and selenium. Additionally, roasting enhances the natural flavors of the pork, creating a tender and juicy dish that's both satisfying and versatile. Whether paired with vegetables, grains, or enjoyed on its own, roasted pork loin is a wholesome and flavorful addition to any diet

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 45 ml olive oil
- 30 ml lemon juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 5 g dried oregano
- 5 g dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the marinade**: In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
2. **Marinate the chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring all pieces are well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for more flavor.
3. **Preheat the grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, ensure the coals are evenly distributed and have a light coating of ash.
4. **Grill the chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center.
5. **Rest and serve**: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing. This helps retain the juices and keeps the chicken tender.
