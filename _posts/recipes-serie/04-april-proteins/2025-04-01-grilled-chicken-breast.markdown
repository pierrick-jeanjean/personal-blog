Grilled chicken breast is an excellent choice for a healthy and delicious meal. It's a lean source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth, making it a great option for those looking to maintain or build muscle mass. Additionally, the marinade used in this recipe, which includes olive oil, lemon juice, and various herbs and spices, not only enhances the flavor but also provides beneficial nutrients. Olive oil is rich in healthy fats that support heart health, while garlic and herbs like oregano and thyme offer antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Grilling the chicken helps to retain its natural juices and flavors without adding unnecessary fats, making it a lighter and more nutritious option compared to frying. Overall, this dish is not only tasty but also supports a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 45 ml olive oil
- 30 ml lemon juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 5 g dried oregano
- 5 g dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the marinade**: In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
2. **Marinate the chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring all pieces are well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for more flavor.
3. **Preheat the grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, ensure the coals are evenly distributed and have a light coating of ash.
4. **Grill the chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center.
5. **Rest and serve**: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing. This helps retain the juices and keeps the chicken tender.
