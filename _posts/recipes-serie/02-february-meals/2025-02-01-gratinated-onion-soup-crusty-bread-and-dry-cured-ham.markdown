#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the gratinated onion soup**:
- 600 g yellow onions (about 3 medium)
- 20 g butter
- 10 mL olive oil
- 10 g all-purpose flour
- 100 mL dry white wine
- 750 mL beef or chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 90 g Gruyère or Comté cheese, grated

**For the crusty bread**:
- 6 slices crusty bread (e.g. baguette or pain de campagne)

**For the dry cured ham**:
- 90 g dry-cured ham (e.g. jambon de pays), thinly sliced

### Instructions

**Caramelize the onions**: <br/>
Slice onions thinly and melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly for 25–30 minutes, stirring often, until deeply golden.

**Build the soup**: <br/>
Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir for one minute. Deglaze with white wine and let it reduce slightly, then add stock, bay leaf, thyme, and pepper. Simmer uncovered for 20–25 minutes, adjust seasoning, and remove herbs.

**Prepare the gratin**: <br/>
Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F), grill mode. Toast bread slices if they’re not already crusty, then ladle soup into three ovenproof bowls. Top each with two slices of bread and a generous layer of grated cheese, and grill for 5–7 minutes until bubbling and golden.

**Serve with dry-cured ham**: <br/> 
Plate the ham separately or drape slices over the edge of the soup bowls for a rustic touch, optionally warming them slightly for a softer texture.
