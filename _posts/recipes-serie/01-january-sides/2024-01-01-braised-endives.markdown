Eating braised endives in France during January is a wonderful way to enjoy seasonal produce. Endives are at their best in winter, and braising them brings out a rich, caramelized flavor that pairs perfectly with hearty winter meals. This dish not only warms you up but also showcases the French tradition of using fresh, local ingredients. Bon appétit! 🍽️

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 3 endives
- 15g butter
- 7g sugar
- 1/2 lemon (juice)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: a splash of white wine or chicken broth

#### Instructions
1. **Prepare the endives**: Trim the bases of the endives and remove any damaged outer leaves. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry.
2. **Caramelize the sugar**: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves and starts to caramelize slightly.
3. **Cook the endives**: Place the endives in the skillet, cut side down if halved, and cook until they start to brown, about 5 minutes.
4. **Add liquid**: Squeeze the lemon juice over the endives. If using, add a splash of white wine or chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper.
5. **Braise**: Cover the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Let the endives cook gently for about 20-30 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are tender and caramelized.
6. **Finish and serve**: Once the endives are tender and golden, remove them from the skillet and serve warm. You can garnish with fresh herbs like parsley if desired.
