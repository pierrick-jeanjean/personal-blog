Eating parsnip pur√©e in January in France is perfect for the season. Parsnips are at their best in winter, offering fresh, nutritious, and comforting flavors. This creamy dish warms you up on cold days and supports local farmers by using seasonal produce. Bon app√©tit! üçΩÔ∏è

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 300g parsnips, peeled and chopped
- 30g butter
- 60ml heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: a pinch of nutmeg or garlic for extra flavor

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the parsnips**: Peel and chop the parsnips into evenly sized pieces to ensure they cook uniformly.
2. **Cook the parsnips**: Place the chopped parsnips in a large pot and cover them with water. Add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the parsnips are tender when pierced with a fork.
3. **Drain and dry**: Drain the parsnips well and return them to the pot. Place the pot back on the stove over low heat for a minute or two to evaporate any excess moisture.
4. **Blend the parsnips**: Transfer the parsnips to a blender or food processor. Add the butter and heavy cream. Blend until smooth and creamy. You can also use a hand blender directly in the pot.
5. **Season**: Season the pur√©e with salt, pepper, and any optional spices like nutmeg or garlic. Blend again to incorporate the seasoning.
6. **Serve**: Transfer the parsnip pur√©e to a serving dish. You can garnish it with a sprinkle of fresh herbs like parsley or chives if desired.
