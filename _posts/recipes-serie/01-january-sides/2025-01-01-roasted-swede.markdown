Roasted swede is a perfect winter side dish in France. It's seasonal, fresh, and packed with nutrients like vitamin C and fiber. Roasting enhances its natural sweetness, making it a delicious and comforting addition to any meal. Enjoying roasted swede in January supports local produce and keeps you nourished during the colder months.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 medium swede (rutabaga), peeled and cut into chunks
- 1.5 tablespoons olive oil
- 1.5 teaspoons honey
- 0.5 teaspoon dried thyme (or a few fresh thyme sprigs)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 clove garlic, minced

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. **Prepare the swede**: Peel the swede and cut it into evenly sized chunks.
3. **Season the swede**: In a large bowl, toss the swede chunks with olive oil, honey, thyme, salt, and pepper. If you're using garlic, add it now.
