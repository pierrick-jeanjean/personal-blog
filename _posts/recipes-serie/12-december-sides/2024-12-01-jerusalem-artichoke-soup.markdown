Eating Jerusalem artichoke soup in December is a great idea because these vegetables are in season, making them fresh and flavorful. The soup is nutritious, packed with iron, potassium, and fiber, perfect for staying healthy in winter. Its warm, comforting texture is ideal for cold days, and using seasonal produce supports local farmers and reduces environmental impact. Enjoying this soup is a delicious way to embrace the winter season in France.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 30ml extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small leek, white and pale green parts, rinsed and finely chopped
- 50g of finely chopped white onion
- 600g of Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and rinsed
- 710ml of vegetable stock
- Sea salt, to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Sauté vegetables**: Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the chopped leek and onion, and sauté for about 5 minutes until they are tender.
2. **Cook artichokes**: Add the Jerusalem artichokes, water or vegetable stock, and sea salt to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes or until the artichokes are soft.
