Cabbage soup is perfect for December in France because cabbage is in season, making it fresh and flavorful. It’s a warm, comforting dish ideal for cold weather, and it’s packed with vitamins and nutrients to boost your immune system during flu season. Plus, it’s economical and nutritious, perfect for sharing with family and friends.


### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 15ml olive oil
- 1/2 large onion, chopped
- 1-2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1-2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 small head of cabbage, cored and chopped
- 400g of diced tomatoes (with juice)
- 710ml of vegetable broth (or chicken/beef broth)
- 1/2 bay leaf
- Dried thyme and dried parsley, to taste
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Chop the cabbage, onion, carrots, celery, and potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Mince the garlic.
2. **Sauté the onion and garlic**: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat 15ml of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes, until softened. Then add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Add the vegetables and broth**: Add the chopped cabbage, carrots, celery, and potatoes to the pot. Pour in the vegetable broth and the diced tomatoes with their juice.
4. **Add seasonings**: Stir in the bay leaf, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. If you’re adding smoked paprika, mix it in now. Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat.
5. **Simmer the soup**: Once the soup reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, covered, for 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. **Taste and adjust**: Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add more salt or pepper if desired.
7. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley or a drizzle of olive oil if desired.
