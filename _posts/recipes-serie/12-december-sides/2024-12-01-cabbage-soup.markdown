### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 large onion, chopped
- 1-2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1-2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 small head of cabbage, cored and chopped
- 1/2 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes (with juice)
- 3 cups vegetable broth (or chicken/beef broth)
- 1/2 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Chop the cabbage, onion, carrots, celery, and potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Mince the garlic.
2. **Saut√© the onion and garlic**: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saut√© for about 3-4 minutes, until softened. Then add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Add the vegetables and broth**: Add the chopped cabbage, carrots, celery, and potatoes to the pot. Pour in the vegetable broth and the diced tomatoes with their juice.
4. **Add seasonings**: Stir in the bay leaf, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. If you‚Äôre adding smoked paprika, mix it in now. Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat.
5. **Simmer the soup**: Once the soup reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, covered, for 30-40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. **Taste and adjust**: Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add more salt or pepper if desired.
7. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley or a drizzle of olive oil if desired.
