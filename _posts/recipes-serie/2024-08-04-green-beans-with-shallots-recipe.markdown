### Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
- 3 large shallots, thinly sliced
- ¾ cup water
- 1 pound (16 ounces) French green beans (haricots verts), trimmed
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:
1. **Heat the oil**: In a large skillet over medium-low heat, add the olive oil or butter.
2. **Cook the shallots**: Add the thinly sliced shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until they are soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Be careful not to brown them.
3. **Add the beans**: Add the trimmed green beans, salt, pepper, and water to the skillet. Bring to a boil.
4. **Simmer**: Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and cook for about 8 minutes.
5. **Finish cooking**: Remove the lid and increase the heat to high. Cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid evaporates, the beans are tender, and the shallots are jammy, about 6 minutes.
6. **Season**: Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
7. **Serve**: Serve warm as a side dish.
