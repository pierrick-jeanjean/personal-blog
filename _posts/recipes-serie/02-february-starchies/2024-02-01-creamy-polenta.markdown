Creamy polenta is a comforting, gluten-free dish rich in carbohydrates and fiber, providing energy and aiding digestion. Enhanced with butter and cheese, it offers additional nutrients and a delicious, versatile base for various toppings.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 750 ml water
- 250 ml milk
- 150g polenta (cornmeal)
- 50g unsalted butter
- 50g grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Bring the water and milk** to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add a pinch of salt.
2. **Gradually whisk in the polenta**, reducing the heat to low. Continue to whisk until the polenta thickens, about 5 minutes.
3. **Cook the polenta**: Stir frequently, cooking for about 20-25 minutes until the polenta is smooth and creamy.
4. **Stir in the butter and Parmesan cheese** until melted and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. **Serve immediately**: Polenta tends to firm up as it cools, so serve it hot and creamy.
