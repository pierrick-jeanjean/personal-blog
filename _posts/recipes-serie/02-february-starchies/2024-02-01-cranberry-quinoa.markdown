Cranberry quinoa is a nutritious, gluten-free dish rich in protein and fiber, providing sustained energy and aiding digestion. The addition of cranberries offers antioxidants and vitamins, while the quinoa itself is a complete protein, making it a healthy and flavorful side.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 150g quinoa
- 300ml vegetable broth or water
- 50g dried cranberries
- 30ml olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2g fresh thyme, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions

1. **Cook the quinoa**: Rinse the quinoa under cold water. In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth or water to a boil. Add the quinoa, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and set aside.
2. **Sauté the onions and garlic**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and thyme, and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
3. **Combine the ingredients**: Add the cooked quinoa and dried cranberries to the skillet. Stir to combine and heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. **Garnish and serve**: Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
