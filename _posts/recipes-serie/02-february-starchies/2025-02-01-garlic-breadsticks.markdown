Garlic breadsticks are a delicious and comforting side that pairs perfectly with soups and stews. They provide a satisfying crunch and a burst of flavor from the garlic and butter. The addition of fresh parsley and Parmesan cheese adds extra depth and richness. These breadsticks are easy to make and can elevate any meal, making them a delightful treat.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 150 g all-purpose flour
-1 tsp instant yeast
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 90 ml warm water
- 1 tbsp olive oil (15 ml)
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter (30 g), melted
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the dough**: In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Add the warm water and olive oil, and mix until a dough forms.
2. **Knead the dough**: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
3. **Let the dough rise**: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
4. **Shape the breadsticks**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Punch down the dough and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long, thin breadstick shape and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. **Bake the breadsticks**: Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
6. **Prepare the garlic butter**: While the breadsticks are baking, combine the melted butter and minced garlic.
7. **Brush with garlic butter**: As soon as the breadsticks come out of the oven, brush them with the garlic butter. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
8. **Serve warm**: Enjoy the breadsticks warm, perfect for dipping into turnip soup.
