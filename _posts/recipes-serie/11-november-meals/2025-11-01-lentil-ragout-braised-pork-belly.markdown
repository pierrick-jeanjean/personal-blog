**For the lentil ragout**:
- ¾ cup dried Puy lentils (Le Puy)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 small carrot, diced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the braised pork belly**:
- 750g boneless pork belly, skin scored
- 1½ tsp kosher salt
- 1 cup dry rosé wine (or white wine)

- Olive oil for searing
- Optional: 1 bay leaf, 1 sprig thyme

### Instructions

- **Preheat** oven to 150°C (300°F).

- **Pour in** wine and 1 cup stock. Add bay leaf and thyme if using.
- **Cover and braise** in oven for 1½ to 2 hours until fork-tender.
- While pork is braising, **heat** olive oil in a saucepan. Sauté onion, carrot, and garlic until soft.
- **Add** lentils and stir to coat. Pour in stock and bring to a boil.
- **Reduce** heat and simmer uncovered for 40–50 minutes until lentils are tender but hold shape.
- **Stir in** vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and keep warm.
- Once braised, **remove** pork from liquid and let rest 10 minutes.
- Optional: **Broil** skin-side up for 5–6 minutes to crisp the top.
