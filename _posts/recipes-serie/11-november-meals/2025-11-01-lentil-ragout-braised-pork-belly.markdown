#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the lentil ragout**:
- 130 g dried Puy lentils (Le Puy)
- 1 small onion — finely chopped
- 1 small carrot — diced
- 1 garlic clove — minced
- 5 ml olive oil — for sautéing aromatics 
- 500 ml chicken or vegetable stock — for lentil cooking
- 15 ml red wine vinegar — for acidity 
- Salt & pepper — to taste

**For the braised pork belly**:
- 330 g pork belly — ideally skinless
- 10 g kosher salt — for dry brine
- 480 ml unsalted chicken stock — for braising
- Optional herbs:
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 sprig fresh thyme

### Instructions

**Preheat the oven for slow braising**: <br/>
Set it to 150°C (300°F) to gently tenderize the pork belly over time.

**Sear the seasoned pork belly**: <br/>
Rub salt into the scored skin, then sear skin-side down in olive oil for 15–20 minutes until golden.

**Add braising liquid and aromatics**: <br/>
Pour in white wine and stock, then add a bay leaf and thyme if desired for fragrance.

**Cover and slow-cook until tender**: <br/>
Braise in the oven for 1½ to 2 hours until the meat is soft and fork-tender.

**Sauté aromatics for the lentil base**: <br/>
While the pork cooks, heat olive oil and gently soften onion, carrot, and garlic in a saucepan.

**Add lentils and infuse with flavor**: <br/>
Stir the lentils to coat in the aromatics, then pour in stock and bring to a boil.

**Simmer until lentils are tender**: <br/>
Lower heat and cook uncovered for 40–50 minutes until the lentils hold shape but are soft.

**Finish with seasoning and acidity**: <br/>
Stir in vinegar and adjust salt and pepper to taste, then keep warm until serving.

**Let the pork belly rest after braising**: <br/>
Remove from the pot and let sit for 10 minutes to relax and retain juices.

**Optionally crisp the skin for texture**: <br/>
Broil skin-side up for 5–6 minutes to achieve a crackling, golden top.
