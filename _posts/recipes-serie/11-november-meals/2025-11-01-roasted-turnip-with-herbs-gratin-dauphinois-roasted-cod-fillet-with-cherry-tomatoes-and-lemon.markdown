### Instructions

**Preheat the oven for roasting the vegetables**: <br/>
Set it to 180°C (350°F) to begin preparation for the turnips, potatoes, and cod.

**Season and prepare the turnips**: <br/>
Peel and quarter the turnips, then toss with olive oil, honey, herbs, paprika, salt, and pepper.

**Roast the turnips until golden**: <br/>
Spread on a baking sheet and cook for 35–40 minutes, turning halfway for even browning.

**Finish turnips with fresh herbs**: <br/>
Sprinkle with chopped parsley just before serving to brighten the flavor.

**Slice and season the potatoes**: <br/>
Peel them thinly, rub a baking dish with garlic, then butter it thoroughly.

**Layer and dress with cream**: <br/>
Arrange the potato slices in layers, seasoning each one. Mix cream, milk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, 
then pour over.

**Bake the gratin until tender and golden**: <br/>
Cook in the oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes until richly browned and easily pierced.

**Prepare tomatoes and cod for roasting**: <br/>
Place cherry tomatoes in a baking dish with garlic, thyme, olive oil, salt, and pepper.

**Top with cod and citrus**: <br/>
Lay fillets over the tomatoes and drizzle with lemon juice and zest to add brightness.

**Bake until the fish flakes easily**: <br/>
Roast for 15–20 minutes until the cod is opaque and cooked through.
