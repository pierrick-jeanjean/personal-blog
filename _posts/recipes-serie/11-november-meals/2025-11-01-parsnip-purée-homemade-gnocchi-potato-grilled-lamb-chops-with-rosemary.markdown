- 400 g parsnips, peeled & chopped
- 150 g floury potato, peeled & chopped
- 1 garlic clove
- 10 g butter (for flavor, reduced)
- 60 mL whole milk (can be semi-skimmed if preferred)
- Salt, pepper, nutmeg

**For the homemade gnocchi potato**:
- 300 g floury potatoes
- 60 g all-purpose flour
- 1 egg yolk
- Salt

**For the grilled lamb chops with rosemary**
- 3 lean lamb chops (about 360 g total)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 sprigs rosemary, chopped
- 10 mL olive oil (for brushing/marinade)
- Salt & pepper

### Instructions

**Boil root vegetables until tender**: <br/>
Cook parsnips, potatoes, and garlic in salted water for about 20 minutes, until easily pierced.
**Blend for a silky mash**: <br/>
Drain and mash with butter and warm milk until smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Keep warm.
**Prepare gnocchi dough from boiled potatoes**: <br/>
Boil whole potatoes in their skin. Peel and mash while still hot to retain texture.
**Incorporate flour and egg yolk**: <br/>
Mix with flour, egg yolk, and a pinch of salt. Knead briefly into a smooth, pliable dough.
**Shape into classic gnocchi**: <br/>
Roll into ropes, slice into 2 cm pieces, and use a fork to mark ridges if desired.
**Boil and finish in butter**: <br/>
Cook the gnocchi in salted water until they rise (2–3 minutes). Drain and sauté in butter until golden and crisp.
**Marinate lamb chops for depth**: <br/>
Rub with garlic, rosemary, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Let sit for at least 30 minutes to infuse.
**Sear or grill to perfection**: <br/>
Cook the chops in a hot pan or on the grill for 3–4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
**Let the meat rest before serving**: <br/>
Allow chops to rest for 5 minutes to keep juices locked in.
