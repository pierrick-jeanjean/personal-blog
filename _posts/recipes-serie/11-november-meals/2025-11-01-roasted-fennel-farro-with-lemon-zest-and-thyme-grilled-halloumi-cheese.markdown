- 240 g halloumi (80 g per person)

### Instructions

**Preheat the oven for roasting**: <br/>
Set it to 200°C to kick off the transformation of fennel into golden perfection.
**Season and toss the fennel wedges**: <br/>
Coat with olive oil, lemon zest, thyme, salt, and pepper for a bright, herbaceous flavor.
**Roast until caramelized and tender**: <br/>
Place in a baking dish and cook for 30–35 minutes, turning halfway through for even coloring.
**Add crunch if desired**: <br/>
Optional: Sprinkle with Parmesan or breadcrumbs during the final 5 minutes for a savory crust.
**Cook farro until tender**: <br/>
Rinse well, then boil in salted water for 25–30 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
**Infuse farro with citrus and herbs**: <br/>
Toss with lemon zest and juice, thyme, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Let it soak up the flavor.
**Grill for texture and depth**: <br/>
Brush lightly with olive oil and grill each side for 2–3 minutes until golden and slightly crisp.
