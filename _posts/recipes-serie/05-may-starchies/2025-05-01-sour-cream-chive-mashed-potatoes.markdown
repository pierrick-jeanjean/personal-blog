Sour cream and chive mashed potatoes are not only delicious but also offer several benefits. The creamy texture and tangy flavor of sour cream enhance the taste, making it a comforting and satisfying dish. Chives add a fresh, mild onion-like flavor and are rich in vitamins A and C, which support immune health. Potatoes themselves are a good source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. This combination creates a balanced side dish that is both nutritious and enjoyable, perfect for any meal. ðŸ¥”ðŸŒ¿
