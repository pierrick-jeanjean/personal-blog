- 1 small shallot (optional, for depth)
- 10 g unsalted butter
- 45 g crème fraîche (or heavy cream)
- 5 g Dijon mustard
- 15 mL lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the crushed baby potatoes with shallot vinaigrette**:
- 600g baby potatoes (Charlotte or Belle de Fontenay)
- 7.5 mL olive oil (for roasting)
- Salt & pepper
- 10 mL extra virgin olive oil
- 15 mL white wine vinegar or lemon juice
- 5 g Dijon mustard
- 1 small shallot, finely minced
- 15 g fresh parsley, chopped
- Optional: zest of ½ lemon for brightness

**For the pan seared cod**:
- 3 cod fillets (150 g each)
- Salt and pepper 
- 7.5 mL olive oil
- 10 g butter
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Chopped parsley (for garnish)

### Instructions

**Prepare the leeks for the base**: <br/>
Slice lengthwise, rinse thoroughly to remove grit, then cut into thin half-moons for even cooking.
**Sauté gently until softened**: <br/>
Melt butter over low heat in a sauté pan, add the leeks (and optional shallot), stir, cover, and cook for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
**Finish with brightness and cream**: <br/>
Add lemon juice, mustard, and crème fraîche. Season with salt and pepper, then cook uncovered for 5–10 minutes until creamy and tender.
**Boil potatoes until tender**: <br/>
Simmer in salted water for 15–20 minutes, then drain and let steam-dry briefly to remove excess moisture.
**Crush and roast to golden perfection**: <br/>
Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F), place potatoes on a tray, gently crush with a fork, drizzle with olive oil, season, and roast for 20–25 minutes.
**Prepare a zingy vinaigrette**: <br/>
Whisk together olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, mustard, finely minced shallot, parsley, and optional citrus zest. Season to taste.
**Dress the potatoes for serving**: <br/>
Spoon vinaigrette over the warm roasted potatoes or serve it on the side for composed plating.
**Season the cod fillets**: <br/>
Pat dry and season both sides with salt and pepper to enhance the fish's natural flavor.
**Sear the cod until golden**: <br/>
Heat olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add cod skin-side down (or presentation side) and cook for 3–4 minutes.
**Baste with garlic butter for richness**: <br/>
Flip the fillets, add butter and garlic to the pan, and spoon the butter over the fish for 2–3 minutes to finish cooking.
**Add a bright finish and serve**: <br/>
Squeeze lemon juice over the cod, sprinkle with parsley, and plate immediately while warm and flaky
