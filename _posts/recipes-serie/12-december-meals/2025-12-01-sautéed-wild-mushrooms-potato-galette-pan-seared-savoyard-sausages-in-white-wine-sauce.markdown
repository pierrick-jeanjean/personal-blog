#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the sautéed wild mushrooms**:
- 300 g mixed wild mushrooms (chanterelles, ceps, hedgehogs)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 15 g chopped parsley
- 5 g butter + 5 mL olive oil
- Salt & pepper
- Optional: splash of white wine

**For the potato galette**:
- 450 g potatoes
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 20 g chopped fresh parsley
- Salt & pepper
- 10 mL olive oil + 5 g butter

**For the pan-seared Savoyard sausage in white wine sauce**:
- 3 Savoyard pork sausages (Savoyard pork sausages)
- 2 small onions, finely sliced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 10 g butter
- 10 g flour
- 200 mL dry white wine (Apremont or Chignin preferred)
- 1 bay leaf + 1 sprig thyme
- Salt & pepper

### Instructions

**Clean the mushrooms gently**: <br/>
Brush off any dirt with a soft brush or damp cloth—avoid washing to preserve texture and prevent sogginess.

**Sauté in butter and oil**: <br/>
Heat both in a pan over medium-high. Add minced garlic, followed by mushrooms. Cook for 6–8 minutes until browned and tender.

**Deglaze with wine (optional)**: <br/>
Add a splash of white wine and stir until the liquid evaporates, deepening the flavor and creating a glossy coating.

**Finish with herbs and seasoning**: <br/>
Stir in chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm, either plated with other components or simply as an appetizer.

**Prep the potatoes for the crique**: <br/>
Peel and grate finely. Wrap in a clean towel and squeeze thoroughly to remove excess moisture—crispness depends on it.

**Mix aromatics into the base**: <br/>
Combine grated potatoes with minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper to form a seasoned galette mixture.

**Cook the crique evenly**: <br/>
Heat butter and oil in a non-stick pan. Spread the mixture into a 1.5 cm thick layer and press down gently.

**Sear until golden and crisp**: <br/>
Cook for 7–8 minutes per side over medium heat. Flip carefully to maintain structure and achieve a uniform crust.

**Serve in wedges**: <br/>
Cut into wedges, keep warm, and consider stacking or nestling beneath the sausage and sauce for composed plating.

**Brown the diots for flavor**: <br/>
In a large pan, melt butter and sear the sausages for 5–6 minutes until golden on all sides. Remove and set aside.

**Sauté onion and garlic**: <br/>
In the same pan, cook sliced onions and garlic until soft and lightly caramelized—about 10–12 minutes over gentle heat.

**Make the sauce**: <br/>
Sprinkle flour over the aromatics and stir well. Slowly pour in white wine while mixing to create a velvety base. Add bay leaf and thyme.

**Simmer the sausages gently**: <br/>
Return the diots to the pan. Cover and cook for 35–40 minutes, turning occasionally. Add a splash of water if the sauce thickens too much.

**Finish and serve warm**: <br/>
Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot, nestled beside crispy crique and buttery mushrooms for a complete Savoyard plate.
