**For the pan seared cod**:

- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 20 g butter
- 15  flour
- 300 mL dry white wine (Apremont or Chignin preferred)
- 1 bay leaf + 1 sprig thyme
- Salt & pepper

### Instructions

- **Clean** mushrooms gently with a brush or damp cloth.
- **Sauté**: Heat butter and oil in a pan. Add garlic, then mushrooms. Cook over medium-high heat for 6–8 minutes.
- **Deglaze** (optional): Add a splash of white wine and cook until evaporated.
- **Finish**: Stir in parsley, season, and serve warm.
- **Prep the potatoes**: Peel and grate them finely. Squeeze out excess moisture using a clean towel.
- **Mix**: In a bowl, combine grated potatoes, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.
- **Cook**: Heat oil and butter in a non-stick pan. Form a 1.5 cm thick layer of the mixture and press down gently.
- **Sear**: Cook over medium heat for 7–8 minutes until golden. Flip and cook the other side for another 7–8 minutes.
- **Serve**: Slice into wedges and keep warm.
- **Brown** the diots: In a large pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the diots and sear until golden on all sides (about 5–6 minutes). Remove and set aside.
- **Sauté** aromatics: In the same pan, add onions and garlic. Cook until soft and lightly caramelized.
- **Make** the sauce: Sprinkle flour over the onions, stir well, then pour in the white wine gradually. Add bay leaf and thyme.
- **Simmer**: Return the diots to the pan. Cover and simmer gently for 35–40 minutes, turning occasionally. Add a splash of water if the sauce thickens too much.
- **Finish**: Season to taste and serve warm with the crique and mushrooms.
