- 150 ml red wine (preferably a fruity variety like Pinot Noir)

### Instructions

**Prep and boil the salsify**: <br/>
Peel carefully and soak in vinegar water to prevent browning, then boil in salted water for 25–30 minutes until tender. Drain thoroughly.
**Sauté aromatics for depth**: <br/>
Cook finely chopped onion and garlic in olive oil until translucent and fragrant.
**Lightly brown the salsify**: <br/>
Add the boiled salsify to the pan and sauté for 5–7 minutes until lightly golden.
**Simmer in tomato and seasonings**: <br/>
Stir in crushed or diced tomatoes, season to taste, and simmer gently for 10–15 minutes.
**Finish with herbs for freshness**: <br/>
Add chopped parsley, chervil, or tarragon if desired, just before serving.
**Start the semolina base with hot milk**: <br/>
Heat milk with butter and a pinch of salt. Once it simmers, slowly whisk in the semolina to avoid clumps.
**Cook until thick and enrich with flavor**: <br/>
Stir over low heat for 3–4 minutes until it thickens, then mix in Parmesan, thyme, nutmeg, and black pepper off the heat.
**Bind with egg and prep for baking**: <br/>
Let it cool slightly, then fold in a beaten egg. Mix thoroughly until smooth.
**Bake the semolina until golden and firm**: <br/>
Pour into a greased dish or ring molds, smooth the surface, and bake at 180°C for 20–25 minutes.
**Rest and unmold the base**: <br/>
Allow to sit briefly, then unmold or slice as desired for serving.
**Poach eggs gently for soft texture**: <br/>
Simmer water with a splash of vinegar. Crack eggs into ramekins and slide into the water.
**Cook just until set**: <br/>
Poach for about 3 minutes, then lift with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Trim wispy edges if needed.
**Make the red wine shallot reduction**: <br/>
Combine wine, minced shallots, thyme, and sugar in a small saucepan.
**Simmer until syrupy and rich**: <br/>
Reduce by half over gentle heat for 10–15 minutes, then remove thyme.
**Finish with butter and seasoning**: <br/>
Off the heat, whisk in cold butter to emulsify. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of red wine vinegar if desired.
