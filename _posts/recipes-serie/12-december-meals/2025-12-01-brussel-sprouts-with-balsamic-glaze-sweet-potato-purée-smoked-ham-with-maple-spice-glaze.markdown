#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the Brussel sprouts with balsamic glaze**:
- 300 g Brussels sprouts
- 10 mL olive oil
- Seasoned balsamic vinegar
- Salt and pepper

**For the sweet potato purée**:
- 400 g sweet potatoes (about 2–3 medium)
- 5 g butter
- 40 mL whole milk or cream
- Salt, pepper, pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- Zest of orange or lemon (optional for brightness)

**For the smoked ham with maple spice**:
- 420 g smoked ham (unsliced, preferably with some fat cap)
- ¼ tsp ground cardamom
- ⅛ tsp ground cinnamon
- ⅛ tsp ground ginger
- Pinch of allspice
- Pinch of salt
- 9–12 whole cloves
- 1 tbsp pure maple syrup

### Instructions

**Prepare the Brussels sprouts for roasting**: <br/>
Trim and halve them, then toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper for crispness and depth.
**Roast until golden and crispy**: <br/>
Spread on a tray and cook at 200°C for 20–25 minutes, turning once for even color.
**Add a final splash of brightness**: <br/>
Drizzle with balsamic vinegar just before serving to balance the richness.
**Steam or boil the sweet potatoes**: <br/>
Peel and dice into 2 cm cubes, then cook in salted water for about 20 minutes until tender.
**Mash to creamy smoothness**: <br/>
Drain and mix with butter and warm milk until velvety and light.
**Season with warm spices and zest**: <br/>
Add salt, pepper, nutmeg, and citrus zest if desired to lift the flavor.
**Bring the ham to room temperature**: <br/>
Let it rest for 30 minutes to ensure even roasting.
**Create a flavorful dry rub**: <br/>
Mix spices and sugar, then rub generously over the entire surface of the ham.
**Score and stud the fat layer**: <br/>
Cut shallow diamond patterns into the fat and press a clove into each—aim for 9–12 total.
**Roast the ham slowly**: <br/>
Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F), place in a dish, and bake uncovered for 50–60 minutes.
**Begin the glaze and caramelization**: <br/>
Baste with half the maple syrup and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
**Finish with high heat for a crackling top**: <br/>
Increase the oven to 230°C (450°F), baste again, and roast for another 10 minutes until golden and glossy.
