Eating celeriac pur√©e in December is great because celeriac is in season, making it fresh and flavorful. It‚Äôs nutritious, with vitamins K and C, and low in calories. Plus, using seasonal produce supports local farmers and is environmentally friendly.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 750g of celeriac, peeled and cut into cubes
- 75g unsalted butter
- 75ml milk
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Boil the celeriac**: Place the celeriac cubes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the celeriac is tender and easily pierced with a fork.
2. **Drain and steam**: Drain the celeriac and return it to the pan. Reduce the heat to low and allow any excess water to evaporate, shaking the pan occasionally.
3. **Mash the celeriac**: Add the butter and milk to the pan. Use a potato masher or a stick blender to mash the celeriac until smooth and creamy. If needed, add more butter or milk to reach your desired consistency.
4. **Season**: Season with salt and pepper to taste
