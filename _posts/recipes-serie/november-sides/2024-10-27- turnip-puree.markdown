Eating turnip pur√©e in November is perfect because turnips are in peak season, making them fresh and flavorful. This dish is nutritious, rich in vitamins, and provides a cozy, comforting side for autumn meals. üçÇ

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 2 large turnips, peeled and cut into uniform chunks
- 2 cups milk
- 2 fresh thyme sprigs
- 1 clove garlic, peeled and gently smashed
- 1/3 cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the turnips**: Peel the turnips and cut them into uniform chunks to ensure even cooking.
2. **Cook the turnips**: In a medium saucepan, combine the turnips, milk, thyme, and garlic. Set over medium heat and partially cover the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until the turnips are tender. You should be able to easily pierce them with the tip of a knife
2. **Drain and Pur√©e**: Drain the turnips, reserving the cooking liquid. Discard the thyme sprigs. Transfer the turnips to a food processor.
3. **Blend**: Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking liquid and the butter to the food processor. Season with plenty of salt and pepper. Pur√©e until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add more of the cooking liquid until you reach the desired consistency.
