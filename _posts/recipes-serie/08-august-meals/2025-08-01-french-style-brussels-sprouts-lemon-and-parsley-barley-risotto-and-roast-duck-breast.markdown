### Instructions

**Trim and prep the Brussels sprouts**: <br/>
Cut off the ends, slice in half, and discard any loose or damaged leaves.

**Boil the sprouts until tender**: <br/>
Cook them in salted boiling water for 5–6 minutes until al dente, then drain.

**Sauté the sprouts for flavor and texture**: <br/>
Heat olive oil in a skillet and sauté until lightly browned and caramelized.

**Add aromatics to enhance taste**: <br/>
Stir in chopped garlic and herbs briefly for extra depth of flavor.

**Braise to soften and infuse flavors**: <br/>
Add a splash of water and simmer until it evaporates, about 2 minutes.

**Season and serve hot**: <br/>
Finish with salt and pepper to taste and plate immediately.

**Toast the barley for flavor**: <br/>
In a dry saucepan over medium heat, stir the barley for 2–3 minutes until lightly golden, then set aside.

**Sauté onion and garlic to build aroma**: <br/>
Heat olive oil in the same pan, add chopped onion and cook for 2 minutes, then stir in garlic and cook another minute.

**Deglaze with wine for depth**: <br/>
Add the toasted barley and white wine, stirring until the liquid is fully absorbed.

**Simmer gradually with broth**: <br/>
Add warm broth in 100 ml increments, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to absorb before adding more. Cook for 40–45 minutes until the barley is tender.

**Finish with fresh herbs and seasoning**: <br/>
Stir in chopped parsley, lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

**Score the duck skin before cooking**: <br/>
Lightly crosshatch the fat, taking care not to cut into the meat.

**Render the fat and crisp the skin**: <br/>
Place skin-side down in a cold pan and cook over medium heat for 6–8 minutes.

**Finish cooking the duck**: <br/>
Flip and cook the flesh side for 2–3 minutes to seal in juices.

**Roast to desired doneness**: <br/>
Transfer to an oven at 180°C and roast for 5–7 minutes for medium-rare.

**Let the duck rest before slicing**: <br/>
Allow to sit for 5 minutes to retain moisture and ensure a perfect slice.
