### Instructions

**Prep the cauliflower into steaks**: <br/>
Remove leaves and trim the stem, then slice into three thick steaks (1.5–2 cm). Save any loose florets for later use.

**Season the cauliflower**: <br/>
Brush both sides with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika for flavor.

**Grill the cauliflower until tender**: <br/>
Cook the steaks over medium-high heat for about 6–7 minutes per side until golden and nicely softened.

**Make the chimichurri sauce**: <br/>
Mix all sauce ingredients thoroughly and adjust the salt and vinegar to your liking.

**Serve with vibrant flavor**: <br/>
Spoon chimichurri over the hot cauliflower steaks and garnish with grilled lemon slices if desired.

**Preheat the oven for roasting**: <br/>
Set your oven to 200°C to ensure a crisp finish for the potatoes.

**Prep the potatoes for roasting**: <br/>
Wash and halve them, then toss with olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper.

**Roast until crispy and golden**: <br/>
Spread the potatoes on a baking tray and roast for 35–40 minutes, turning halfway through for even browning.

**Finish with fresh herbs**: <br/>
Sprinkle the hot roasted potatoes with chopped fresh rosemary just before serving.

**Bring meat to room temperature**: <br/>
Set steaks out 30 minutes ahead so they cook evenly.

**Heat grill or pan for searing**: <br/>
Get it very hot, then brush steaks with olive oil to prevent sticking and enhance flavor.

**Grill steaks to preferred doneness**: <br/>
Sear each side for 2–3 minutes for medium-rare, adjusting cooking time to your taste.

**Season strategically**: <br/>
Add pepper while cooking and finish with salt just after grilling to lock in flavor.

**Deglaze the pan for extra richness (optional)**: <br/>
Pour in a splash of vinegar or Porto, reduce briefly, and drizzle the sauce over the steaks.

**Rest before slicing and serving**: <br/>
Let the steaks sit for 5 minutes to retain juices and ensure tenderness.
