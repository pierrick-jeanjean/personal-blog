#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the shredded white cabbage with vinaigrette**:
- 250 g white cabbage (about ¼ of a medium head), finely shredded
- 3 g Dijon mustard
- 10 mL white wine vinegar
- 20 mL olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the couscous with olive oil and lemon**:
- 150 g dry couscous (semoule de blé)
- 150 mL boiling vegetable broth or water
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 15 mL extra virgin olive oil
- A handful of chopped parsley or coriander
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the grilled sausage**:
- 3 Toulouse sausages
- 5 mL olive oil
- Optional: sprigs of thyme or rosemary

### Instructions

**Prepare the vinaigrette**: <br/>
Whisk together mustard, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl until smooth and emulsified.

**Dress and marinate the cabbage**: <br/>
Toss shredded cabbage with the vinaigrette and let it sit for 15–30 minutes to soften and soak up the flavors.

**Add extra seasoning for flair (optional)**: <br/>
Mix in a pinch of Espelette pepper or a few caraway seeds to give it a unique aromatic twist.

**Hydrate the couscous (semoule)**: <br/>
Place the couscous in a bowl, pour over hot broth, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.

**Fluff and season the couscous**: <br/>
Add lemon juice, zest, olive oil, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper, then gently mix with a fork to keep the grains light and fluffy.

**Serve couscous warm or at room temperature**: <br/>
It pairs beautifully either way, depending on your preference or the occasion.

**Preheat the grill or pan for the sausages**: <br/>
Bring it to medium-high heat to ensure a nice sear and even cooking.

**Grill the sausages to perfection**: <br/>
Cook them for 10–12 minutes, turning regularly until browned on all sides and fully cooked through.

**Enhance flavor during grilling (optional)**: <br/>
Brush sausages with olive oil and sprinkle herbs over them while cooking for an aromatic touch.
