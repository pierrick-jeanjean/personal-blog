#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the shredded white cabbage with vinaigrette**:
- 300 g white cabbage (about ¼ of a medium head), finely shredded
- 5 g Dijon mustard
- 15 mL white wine vinegar
- 45 mL olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the couscous with olive oil and lemon**:
- 180 g medium couscous (semoule de blé)

### Instructions

- **Prepare the vinaigrette**: In a bowl, whisk together mustard, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
- **Dress the cabbage**: Toss the shredded cabbage with the vinaigrette. Let it sit for 15–30 minutes to soften slightly and absorb flavor.
- **Optional**: Add a pinch of Espelette pepper or a few caraway seeds for a twist.
- **Hydrate the semoule**: Place couscous in a bowl, pour over hot broth, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes.
- **Fluff and season**: Add lemon juice, zest, olive oil, herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with a fork.
- **Serve** warm or room temperature.
- **Preheat** your grill or pan: Medium-high heat.
- **Cook the sausages**: Grill for about 10–12 minutes, turning regularly until browned and cooked through.
- **Optional flavor boost**: Brush with olive oil and sprinkle herbs during cooking
