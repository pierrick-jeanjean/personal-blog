Asparagus with vinaigrette is great because it's nutrient-rich, low in calories, and high in fiber, which helps you feel full. It contains antioxidants that protect your cells, supports digestive health, and is good for your heart due to its folate and potassium content. Additionally, asparagus acts as a natural diuretic, helping to reduce bloating.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 450 g of asparagus (trimmed)
- 2.5 g Dijon mustard
- 15 ml champagne vinegar (or white wine vinegar)
- 2.5 g teaspoon sugar
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 30 ml extra-virgin olive oil
- 5 ml teaspoon lemon zest
- 2.5 teaspoon finely chopped fresh tarragon (optional)
- Ice water (for blanching)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the asparagus**: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt. Add the asparagus and cook until they are bright green and tender, about 3 minutes.Transfer the asparagus to a bowl of ice water to cool. Drain well and pat dry.
2. **Make the vinaigrette**: In a small bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, champagne vinegar, and sugar.Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the olive oil until the vinaigrette is well combined. Add the lemon zest and tarragon (if using), and whisk to combine. Adjust seasoning to taste.
3. **Combine and serve**: Arrange the asparagus on a serving platter. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the asparagus. Serve immediately, or let stand at room temperature for up to 30 minutes before serving.
