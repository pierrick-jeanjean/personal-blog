Radish salad is great because radishes are low in calories and high in nutrients like vitamin C and fiber. They help with digestion, boost the immune system, and add a refreshing crunch to meals. Enjoying radish salad is a tasty way to stay healthy! ðŸŒ¿

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 1 bunch of radishes (about 10-12 radishes), thinly sliced
- 1 cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 15 g fresh dill, chopped
- 30 ml olive oil
- 15 ml lemon juice
- 5 g teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Wash and thinly slice the radishes, cucumber, and red onion. Place them in a large salad bowl.
