Eating an endive tart is beneficial because endives are rich in essential vitamins (A, C, K), minerals (potassium, folate), and dietary fiber, which support overall health, digestion, and heart function. They are low in calories and contain antioxidants that protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation. Combining endives with goat cheese and thyme in a tart makes for a nutritious and delicious dish that can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 3 large endives
- 1 sheet of puff pastry (store-bought or homemade)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 50 grams (about 1.75 ounces) of goat cheese, crumbled
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the endives**: Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Trim the bases of the endives and cut them in half lengthwise. In a large ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the butter. Place the endives cut side down in the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until they start to caramelize and turn golden brown. Add the balsamic vinegar and let it reduce for a minute. Season with salt and pepper
2. **Assemble the tart**: Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to fit the size of your skillet. Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese and thyme (if using) over the caramelized endives in the skillet. Carefully place the puff pastry over the endives, tucking the edges around the sides of the skillet
3. **Bake the tart**: Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and puffed. Remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes
4. **Serve**: Carefully invert the tart onto a serving plate so the endives are on top. Slice and serve warm.
