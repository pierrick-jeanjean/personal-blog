Mashed potatoes are a comforting and nutritious side dish. They provide energy through carbohydrates and are rich in vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, B6, and potassium. When made with milk and butter, they also offer calcium and healthy fats. Enjoying mashed potatoes can support your overall health while satisfying your taste buds. ðŸ¥”âœ¨

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 700g of Yukon Gold potatoes
- 60ml cup of whole milk
- 60ml cup of heavy cream
- 60g cup of unsalted butter (cubed, cold)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh chives (finely chopped, for serving)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the potatoes**: Peel and cut the potatoes into evenly sized chunks.
2. **Boil the potatoes**: Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender (about 15-20 minutes).
3. **Drain and dry**: Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Cook over low heat for a few minutes to evaporate any remaining moisture.
4. **Mash the potatoes**: Use a potato masher or ricer to mash the potatoes until smooth.
5. **Add ingredients**: In a small saucepan, heat the milk and cream. Gradually add the butter to the potatoes, mashing until incorporated. Slowly add the warm milk mixture, stirring until the potatoes are creamy.
6. **Season and serve**: Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Garnish with finely chopped chives.
