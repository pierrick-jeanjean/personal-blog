Eating roasted potatoes in January is great because they are hearty and comforting, perfect for cold weather. They provide essential nutrients like vitamin C and potassium, boosting your immune system. Plus, their warmth and crispiness add a cozy touch to winter meals, making them a delicious and nutritious choice. 🥔🍽️

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 700g of Yukon Gold potatoes
- 20ml of olive oil
- Garlic powder and paprika, to taste
- Fresh herbs (like rosemary, thyme, or parsley), chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven** to 425°F (220°C).
2. **Prepare the potatoes**: Wash and cut them into even-sized chunks (about 2 inches).
3. **Season the potatoes**: In a large bowl, toss the potato chunks with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Make sure they are well coated.
4. **Roast the potatoes**: Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Flip them halfway through to ensure even cooking.
5. **Add fresh herbs**: Once the potatoes are done, sprinkle them with fresh herbs and give them a final toss.
