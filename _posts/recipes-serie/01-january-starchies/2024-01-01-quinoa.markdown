Quinoa is a nutrient-dense food that’s high in protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals. It’s a complete protein, gluten-free, and packed with antioxidants, making it great for digestion, reducing inflammation, and overall health.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 1.5 cups quinoa (rinsed)
- 3 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)

#### Instructions
1. **Rinse the quinoa**: Place the quinoa in a fine mesh colander and rinse under running water for at least 30 seconds to remove any bitterness.
2. **Cook the quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
3. **Simmer**: Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered until the quinoa has absorbed all the water, about 10-20 minutes.
4. **Steam**: Remove the pot from heat, cover it, and let the quinoa steam for 5 minutes to become fluffy.
5. **Fluff and serve**: Fluff the quinoa with a fork and serve
