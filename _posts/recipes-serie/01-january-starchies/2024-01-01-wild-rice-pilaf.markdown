Eating wild rice pilaf in January is great because it’s a hearty, nutritious dish that provides essential nutrients like protein and fiber. The warm, comforting flavors of the pilaf, combined with seasonal vegetables, make it perfect for cold winter days. Plus, it’s versatile and pairs well with various proteins, helping you stay energized and healthy during the winter season.

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 1 cup wild rice blend
- 1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- 1 small carrot, diced
- ½ cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- ¾ cups low-sodium chicken broth (or vegetable broth)

#### Instructions

1. **Sauté vegetables**: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and diced carrot, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.
2. **Cook rice**: Stir in the wild rice blend, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 40-45 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.
3. **Rest and fluff**: Remove the pot from heat and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Then, remove the lid and gently fluff the rice with a fork.
