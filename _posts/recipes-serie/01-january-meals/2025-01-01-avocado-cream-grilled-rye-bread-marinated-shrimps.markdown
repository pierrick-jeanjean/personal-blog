#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

- 30 g fromage frais (e.g. St Môret)
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 pinch paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil (optional, for garnish)

**For the grilled rye bread**:
- 6 slices of rye bread
- Olive oil or butter (optional)

**For the marinated shrimps**:
- 300 g raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 30 mL olive oil
- Juice of ½ lemon
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 15 g chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper
- Optional: pinch of Espelette pepper or chili flake

### Instructions

**Prepare the avocado base**: <br/>
Peel and pit the avocados, then cut into rough chunks for easy blending.

**Blend until creamy and smooth**: <br/>
In a blender, combine avocado, crème entière, fromage frais, lime juice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Blitz until velvety.

**Chill for optimal texture**: <br/>
Transfer to verrines or small bowls. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up and allow flavors to meld.

**Garnish with basil and serve**: <br/>
Top each portion with chopped fresh basil for a herbal lift. Serve chilled alongside crisped bread and shrimp.

**Brush the bread slices**: <br/>
Lightly coat with olive oil or softened butter—just enough for golden color.

**Toast or grill until crisp**: <br/>
Cook until golden and lightly crunchy, either under a grill or in a dry pan.

**Cut and serve as accompaniment**: <br/>
Slice into triangles or serve whole beside the avocado crème and shrimp, ideal for scooping or layering.

**Prepare the shrimp marinade**: <br/>
In a mixing bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and chili (if using).

**Marinate the shrimp**: <br/>
Add raw peeled shrimp and toss until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 30–60 minutes to absorb flavors.

**Sauté quickly for perfect texture**: <br/>
Heat a pan until hot. Sear shrimp for 2–3 minutes per side until pink and slightly golden.

**Serve warm or chilled**: <br/>
Shrimp can be plated warm for contrast or chilled for a refreshing note with the avocado crème.
