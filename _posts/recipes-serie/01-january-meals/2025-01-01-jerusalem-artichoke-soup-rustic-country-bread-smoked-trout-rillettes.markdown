**For the Jerusalem artichoke soup**:
- 600 g topinambours (Jerusalem artichokes), peeled and chopped
- 1 medium potato (about 150 g), peeled and chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 10 mL olive oil
- ½ vegetable bouillon cube
- 600 mL water
- 60 mL crème fraîche or heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: drizzle of truffle oil or crushed walnuts for garnis

**For the rustic country bread**:
- 3 slices of rustic country bread (pain de campagne)
- 1 garlic clove, halved
- Olive oil or butter for brushing

**For the smoked trout rillettes**:
- 150 g smoked trout fillet (skin removed)
- 30 mL crème fraîche (or sour cream)
- Zest of ½ lemon + 5 mL lemon juice
- 15 g finely chopped chives
- 5 g finely chopped dill (optional)
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch of salt (if needed)

### Instructions

**Sauté the aromatics for the soup base**: <br/>
Heat olive oil in a pot and cook the onion until translucent, releasing sweetness without browning.

**Add topinambours and potatoes**: <br/>
Stir the chopped vegetables for 2–3 minutes to begin softening and infusing with flavor.

**Simmer until tender**: <br/>
Pour in water and add a bouillon cube. Cook gently for 25–30 minutes until the vegetables are fully tender.

**Blend until smooth and creamy**: <br/>
Use a stick mixer or blender, then add cream. Season with salt and pepper, and reheat gently for serving.

**Finish with optional garnishes**: <br/>
Serve hot with a swirl of truffle oil or a sprinkle of crushed walnuts for a luxe, earthy touch.

**Prepare the bread accompaniment**: <br/>
Brush slices with olive oil or butter to ensure crispness and flavor when toasted.

**Toast until golden and aromatic**: <br/>
Cook in a pan or oven until golden brown, then rub with garlic while still warm for depth.

**Flake the smoked trout for the spread**: <br/>
Use a fork to break into uneven, bite-sized pieces—texture makes all the difference.

**Mix into a creamy herbed base**: <br/>
Combine with crème fraîche, lemon zest and juice, chives, and dill. Season with black pepper and a touch of salt (adjust to taste).

**Rest and chill to meld flavors**: <br/>
Refrigerate the mixture for 15–30 minutes to allow the herbs and lemon to settle into the trout.
