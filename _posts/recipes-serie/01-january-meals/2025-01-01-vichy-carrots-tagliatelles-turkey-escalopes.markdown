#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the Vichy carrots**:
- 500 g carrots (Chantenay or regular, peeled and sliced into coins)
- 10 g unsalted butter
- 10 g caster sugar
- 175 mL water
- A squeeze of lemon juice
- 30 g chopped parsley or chives
- Pinch of salt

**For the tagliatelles**:
- 210 g of fresh tagliatelles

**For the turkey escalopes**:
- 3 turkey breast steaks (150 g each)
- 30 g flour
- 1 egg
- 20 mL milk
- 60 g panko breadcrumbs
- 30 g grated Parmesan
- 5 g dried thyme
- 5 g dried rosemary
- Salt & pepper
- Neutral oil for frying
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

### Instructions

**Build the glaze base**: <br/>
Place carrots in a saucepan with butter, sugar, salt, and water.

**Simmer for tenderness and sweetness**: <br/>
Bring to a boil, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.

**Reduce and finish the glaze**: <br/>
Uncover and continue cooking 8–10 minutes until the liquid thickens and coats the carrots.

**Brighten and garnish**: <br/>
Toss gently in the glaze, add lemon juice, and sprinkle with fresh herbs for freshness.

**Boil briefly for perfect texture**: <br/>
Cook tagliatelles in salted water for 2–3 minutes until al dente. Drain and reserve.

**Tenderize the meat**: <br/>
Flatten turkey steaks to about 1 cm thickness using a rolling pin or mallet.

**Prepare a three-step breading station**: <br/>
Set up bowls for seasoned flour, beaten egg with milk, and a breadcrumb mixture enriched with herbs and Parmesan.

**Coat each escalope for crunch**: <br/>
Dredge each steak in flour, dip into egg, and finish in the breadcrumb mix.

**Rest for cohesion**: <br/>
Chill for 15 minutes to help the coating adhere and prevent breaking during frying.

**Fry until golden perfection**: <br/>
Cook in a pan with oil for 3 minutes per side until crisp and fully cooked.

**Drain and serve with citrus**: <br/>
Transfer to paper towel and finish with a squeeze of lemon for zing
