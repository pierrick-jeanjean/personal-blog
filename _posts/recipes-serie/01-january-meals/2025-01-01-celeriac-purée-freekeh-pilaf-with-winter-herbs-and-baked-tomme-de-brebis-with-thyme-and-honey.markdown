**For the baked Tomme de brebis with thyme and honey**:
- 300 g Tomme de Brebis (cut into 3 thick slices or use a small wheel)

### Instructions

**Prep the celeriac for cooking**: <br/>
Peel and dice into 2 cm cubes. If prepping ahead, soak in lemon water to prevent oxidation.

**Simmer with aromatics**: <br/>
Place celeriac and garlic in a saucepan, cover with lightly salted water, and simmer 15–20 minutes until fork-tender.

**Drain and release moisture**: <br/>
Drain well and let sit uncovered for 2 minutes so steam escapes and texture improves.

**Blend until smooth and creamy**: <br/>
Transfer to a blender or use a stick mixer. Add butter, warm milk, salt, pepper, and lemon juice, then blend to a silky purée.

**Refine the texture**: <br/>
Taste and adjust seasoning. For extra finesse, pass through a fine sieve for an ultra-smooth finish.

**Prep the freekeh grain**: <br/>
Rinse thoroughly, then soak in cold water for 5 minutes. Drain well to improve texture while cooking.

**Sauté aromatics for depth**: <br/>
Heat olive oil in a saucepan. Add chopped onion and cook until soft and golden.

**Toast freekeh and bloom the spices**: <br/>
Add the drained freekeh and selected spices. Stir for 2–3 minutes until lightly toasted.

**Simmer until tender**: <br/>
Add stock, bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and simmer for 25–30 minutes until grains are tender and liquid absorbed.

**Finish with zest and herbs**: <br/>
Stir in lemon zest and juice, chopped herbs, and season to taste. Optional: fold in toasted nuts for crunch.

**Prepare the cheese for baking**: <br/>
Preheat oven to 180°C (356°F). Place cheese slices or a wheel into a parchment-lined baking dish.

**Layer on the aromatics**: <br/>
Brush lightly with olive oil, drizzle evenly with honey, add thyme sprigs, and a crack of black pepper if desired.

**Bake until golden and gooey**: <br/>
Cook for 10–12 minutes until soft, bubbling, and just beginning to caramelize.

**Serve immediately for spreading**: <br/>
Enjoy warm with a spoon or knife—perfect over walnut bread or endive leaves for elegant scooping.
