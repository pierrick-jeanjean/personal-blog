Grilled salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart health and reduce inflammation. It's also a great source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals. Grilling preserves its nutrients and adds a delicious smoky flavor without extra fats, making it a nutritious and tasty meal option. üêü

#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 3 salmon fillets
- 20ml olive oil
- 15ml lemon juice
- 1.5 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh herbs (like dill or parsley) for garnish

#### Instructions
1. **Prepare the marinade**: In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
2. **Marinate the salmon**: Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Let them marinate for at least 15-30 minutes.
3. **Preheat the grill**: Heat your grill to medium-high heat.
4. **Grill the salmon**: Place the salmon fillets on the grill, skin-side down. Grill for about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets, until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
5. **Serve**: Remove the salmon from the grill and garnish with fresh herbs. Serve with your favorite sides, like grilled vegetables or a fresh salad.
