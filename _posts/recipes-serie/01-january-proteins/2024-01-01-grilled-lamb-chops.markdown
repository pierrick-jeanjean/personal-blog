Grilled lamb chops are delicious and nutritious. They provide high-quality protein, vitamin B12, zinc, and iron, which are essential for muscle repair, immune function, and energy. The grilling process enhances the lamb's natural flavors, making it tender and juicy, while fresh herbs add a burst of flavor without heavy sauces. Enjoying grilled lamb chops is a tasty and healthy meal option.

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 6 lamb chops
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Fresh rosemary and thyme, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 45ml tablespoons olive oil
- 1 lemon, juiced

### Instructions:
1. **Marinate the lamb chops**: In a bowl, combine minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice. Mix well.
2. **Coat the chops**: Place the lamb chops in the bowl and coat them thoroughly with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.
3. **Preheat the Grill**: Heat your grill to medium-high heat.
4. **Grill the Chops**: Remove the lamb chops from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Grill the chops for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
5. **Rest and serve**: Let the lamb chops rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute
