- 500 g celeriac (peeled and cubed)
- 5 mL olive oil
- 5 g fresh thyme leaves
- 5 g chopped rosemary
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- Salt & black pepper, to taste

**For the roasted baby potatoes**:
- 300 g baby potatoes (washed, halved)
- 5 mL olive oil
- 5 g chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- Sea salt & black pepper, to taste

**For the grilled duck breast**:
- 1½ medium skin-on duck breasts (~180 g total)
- 10 g ground cumin
- 10 g smoked paprika
- 10 g garlic powder
- 5 g onion powder
- 2.5 g cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- 2.5 g dried oregano
- Salt & black pepper, to taste


### Instructions

**Heat the oven to 200°C fan.**: <br/>
Get it prepped and toasty so both celeriac and potatoes roast to perfection.

**Toss celeriac cubes in herby olive oil.**: <br/>
Coat evenly with garlic, salt, pepper, and herbs of your choice—thyme and sage work wonders.

**Spread out and roast until golden.**: <br/>
Lay the cubes on a baking tray and roast for 30–35 minutes, turning halfway for even caramelization.

**Toss potatoes with rosemary and garlic.**: <br/>
Give them the olive oil treatment, seasoned boldly with salt and pepper.

**Roast until crisp and tender inside**: <br/>
Bake for 25–30 minutes—expect golden edges and melt-in-your-mouth softness.

**Score the skin in a crosshatch pattern**: <br/>
Use a sharp knife and gently slice into the fat without reaching the meat—this helps the rub and 
heat penetrate evenly.

**Create a bold rub and coat the duck well**: <br/>
Mix spices and sugar in a bowl. Rub generously over both sides of the duck breasts, pressing the mix into the scored skin.

**Let it marinate at room temperature**: <br/>
Set the duck aside for 30–60 minutes so the flavors can settle in and do their magic.

**Preheat the grill to medium-high (350°F / 175°C)**: <br/>
Get it hot and steady, the key to crisp skin without overcooking.

**Grill skin-side down to render the fat**: <br/>
Place the duck breasts skin-side down for 7–9 minutes until golden, crispy, and full of sizzle.

**Flip and finish to perfection**: <br/>
Grill the other side for 3–5 minutes, aiming for an internal temperature of 165°F / 74°C for medium 
doneness.

**Rest before slicing to lock in juiciness**: <br/>
Let the meat sit for 5–10 minutes, then slice diagonally for presentation flair and tender bite.
