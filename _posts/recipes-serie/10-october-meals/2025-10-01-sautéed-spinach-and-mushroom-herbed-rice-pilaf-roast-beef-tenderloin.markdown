### Instructions

**Start with a fragrant mushroom-spinach sauté**: <br/>
Sauté shallot and garlic in butter and oil until soft and translucent.

**Give the mushrooms some golden character**: <br/>
Add them to the pan and cook until browned and moisture has evaporated.

**Deglaze the pan for depth**: <br/>
Splash in white wine (optional) and reduce slightly to concentrate flavors.

**Finish with fresh spinach and warm spice**: <br/>
Stir in spinach until wilted, and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

**Keep warm until ready to serve**: <br/>
This savory side pairs beautifully with rice or filet.

**Begin the rice with a herby foundation**: <br/>
Heat oil and sauté onion, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper for 3 minutes.

**Stir in the rice until coated and glossy**: <br/>
Then pour in broth and bring to a boil for full absorption.

**Simmer low and slow**: <br/>
Cover and cook on low for 15 minutes so flavors infuse deeply.

**Add vibrant crunch**: <br/>
Toss in diced bell pepper, cover, and cook 7–9 more minutes until rice is tender.

**Brighten with fresh parsley**: <br/>
Uncover and stir in chopped parsley, letting it rest 5 minutes before serving.

**Prep your filet for a perfect roast**: <br/>
Let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes to ensure even cooking.

**Crank the oven to 200°C**: <br/>
Get your pan blazing hot for a beautiful sear.

**Sear with aromatics until deeply browned**: <br/>
Use oil, garlic, and herbs to crisp the exterior and seal in juices.

**Transfer to the oven and season boldly**: <br/>
Place in a dish and roast 20–25 minutes for medium-rare perfection.

**Let it rest under foil**: <br/>
This 10-minute pause locks in moisture before slicing.
