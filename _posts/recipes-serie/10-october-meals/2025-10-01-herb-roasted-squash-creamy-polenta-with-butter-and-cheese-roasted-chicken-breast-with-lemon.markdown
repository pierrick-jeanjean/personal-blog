- 5 mL olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 5 g fresh thyme
- 5 g rosemary
- Salt & black pepper, to taste

**For the creamy polenta with butter and cheese**:
- 90 g dry polenta (fine or medium grind)
- 600 mL water or vegetable stock (light, low-fat if possible)
- 30 g grated cheese (Parmesan for umami kick or Gruyère for creaminess)
- Salt, to taste

**For the roasted chicken breast with lemon**:
- 3 medium chicken breasts (~525 g total, 175 g each)
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- Optional: pinch of herbes de Provence

### Instructions

**Preheat the oven for the roasted squash**: <br/>
Set it to 200°C to get a head start on caramelizing the cubes to golden perfection.

**Season the squash generously**: <br/>
Toss with olive oil, minced garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper for bold flavor.

**Roast until golden and tender**: <br/>
Spread on a baking tray and cook for 30–35 minutes, flipping halfway through.

**Boil water or stock for the polenta base**: <br/>
Add a pinch of salt and bring to a rolling boil in a saucepan.

**Whisk in polenta slowly to prevent clumps**: <br/>
Reduce heat to low and stir consistently to keep it smooth.

**Cook until creamy and rich**: <br/>
Simmer for 20–25 minutes, stirring frequently as it thickens.

**Enrich the polenta just before serving**: <br/>
Stir in butter and cheese for a velvety finish with depth.

**Preheat the oven for the chicken**: <br/>
Set it to 190°C for a juicy roast with crisped skin.

**Season and rub the chicken thoroughly**: <br/>
Coat with olive oil, garlic, lemon zest and juice, salt, pepper, and fresh herbs.

**Roast until cooked through**: <br/>
Place in a baking dish and bake for 20–25 minutes until golden and fully done.

**Let the chicken rest before slicing**: <br/>
Allow 5 minutes for juices to redistribute—essential for tenderness.
