#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)

**For the creamy endive and leek soup**:
- 375 g endives (about 3 medium)
- 2 small leeks (white part only)
- 225 g potatoes (floury variety)
- 900 ml semi-skimmed milk
- 50 ml crème fraîche
- 5 g butter
- 3 g curry powder (optional)
- 1 pinch sugar
- Salt & pepper

**For the butter-sautéed potatoes**:
- 450 g potatoes (waxy variety like Charlotte)
- 5 mL olive oil
- 1 garlic clove (optional)
- Salt & pepper
- Parsley (for garnish)

**For the scrambled egg**:
- 3 large eggs
- 10 g butter
- Salt to taste

### Instructions

**Prepare the vegetables**: <br/>
Wash and slice the leeks, peel and cube the potatoes, and trim the endives—removing the bitter core for better flavor.

**Sauté the endives and leeks**: <br/>
Melt butter in a pot, add the sliced vegetables, and cook gently for about 5 minutes until lightly softened.

**Simmer the soup mixture**: <br/>
Add curry powder, milk, cubed potatoes, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

**Blend until smooth and creamy**: <br/>
Use an immersion blender to purée the mixture until silky. Stir in crème fraîche and adjust seasoning as needed.

**Precook the potatoes for crisping**: <br/>
Peel and cube a second batch of potatoes, boil in salted water for 5 minutes, then drain and pat dry thoroughly.

**Sauté the potatoes until golden**: <br/>
Heat oil and butter in a heavy pan and cook the cubes over medium heat for about 15 minutes, turning regularly until crisp and browned.

**Finish the potatoes with flavor**: <br/>
Add minced garlic during the final 2 minutes of cooking. Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley.

**Whisk the eggs to a silky consistency**: <br/>
Beat them in a bowl until smooth and evenly combined, with no streaks of white or yolk.

**Melt butter to prep the pan**: <br/>
Use a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, letting the butter coat the surface gently.

**Cook the eggs slowly and gently**: <br/>
Pour in the whisked eggs and stir with a spatula until softly set—delicate, creamy curds are the goal.
