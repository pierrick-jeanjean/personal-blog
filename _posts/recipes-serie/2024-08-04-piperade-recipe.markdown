Piperade is a vibrant Basque dish that combines bell peppers, onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Slow-cooked to perfection, it’s bursting with flavor and pairs wonderfully with crusty bread or as a side for meats and fish. 

### Ingredients (for 3 persons):
- 2 large bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), sliced thickly
- 1 large sweet onion, sliced thickly
- 3 cloves garlic, mashed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt, to taste
- 1 cup pureed San Marzano tomatoes

### Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large, ovenproof Dutch oven, warm olive oil over medium-high heat.
3. Add the onions and garlic, stirring occasionally until tender and translucent (about 5-10 minutes).
4. Mix in the herbes de Provence, bell peppers, paprika, and salt. Cook until the peppers soften (about 10 minutes).
5. Stir in the pureed San Marzano tomatoes and bring everything to a boil.
6. Transfer the Dutch oven to the oven and let it cook for about 30 minutes until everything is fully cooked and soft.
7. Serve hot as a side dish or with crusty bread.
