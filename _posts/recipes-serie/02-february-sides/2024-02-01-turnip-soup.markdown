#### Ingredients (for 3 persons)
- 10 ml olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced (about 70 grams)
- 450 grams turnips, peeled and diced
- 1 small potato, peeled and diced (about 150 grams)
- 1 small Granny Smith apple, peeled and diced (about 100 grams)
- 320 ml chicken broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian option)
- 3 grams kosher salt (or to taste)
- 1 gram curry powder

#### Instructions

1. **Sauté the onion**: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until it becomes tender and translucent.
2. **Add the vegetables and apple**: Add the diced turnips, potato, and apple to the pot. Stir well to combine with the onions.
3. **Add the broth and seasonings**: Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Add the kosher salt and curry powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20-25 minutes.
4. **Blend the soup**: Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth and creamy. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can carefully transfer the soup to a countertop blender in batches.
5. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs or croutons if desired. Enjoy your warm, creamy turnip soup!
