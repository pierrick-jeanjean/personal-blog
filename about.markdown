ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pierrick, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm a solution architect at Volvo Group, where I design and build IT solution based on requirements/problematics gathered from the business.

My background includes a strong experience as developer and as technical leader, helping me to encounter and resolve a lot of issue during development stage.

In my free time, you'll find me playing tennis/basket or reading a book/watching a movie. I also like to discover new countries, next trip is already set to Edinburgh in Scotland
